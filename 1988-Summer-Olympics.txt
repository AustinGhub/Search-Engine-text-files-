The '''1988 Summer Olympics''', officially known as the '''Games of the XXIV Olympiad''' ({{Korean|hangul=서울 하계 올림픽|Korean|hanja=서울 夏季 올림픽 |rr=Seoul Hagye Ollimpik}}), were an international [[multi-sport event]] celebrated from 17 September to 2 October 1988 in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. They were the second summer Olympic Games to be held in Asia and the first since the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] held in Tokyo, Japan. It was also the first Olympic Games to be held in mainland Asia and the fourth Olympic Games to be held in autumn. The 1988 Games were the second to be held in a [[developing country]], after the 1968 Games in Mexico (South Korea was still considered a developing country at the time of the games).

In the Seoul Games, 159 nations were represented by a total of 8,391 athletes: 6,197 men and 2,194 women. 263 events were held and 27,221 volunteers helped to prepare the Olympics. 11,331 media (4,978 [[print media|written press]] and 6,353 [[broadcast media|broadcasters]]) showed the Games all over the world.<ref name="SEOUL 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad"/>

These were the last Olympic Games for two of the world's "dominating" sport powers, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[East Germany]], as both ceased to exist before the next Olympic Games.

[[North Korea]], still officially at war with South Korea, and its allies, [[Albania]], [[Cuba]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Seychelles]] boycotted the games. For differing reasons, [[Ethiopia]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Albania]] (who declared an Olympic-record fourth consecutive boycott) did not participate in the Games. However, the much larger boycotts seen in the previous three Summer Olympics were avoided, resulting in the largest ever number of participating nations during the Cold War era.

==Host city selection==
Seoul was chosen to host the [[Summer Olympics|Summer Games]] through a vote held on 30 September 1981, finishing ahead of the Japanese city of [[Nagoya]].<ref name="SEOUL 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad">{{cite web

* In the [[Gymnastics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Women's artistic team all-around|Women's Artistic Gymnastics Team All-Around Competition]], the US women's team is penalized with a deduction of five tenths of a point from their team score by the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG)]] after the compulsory round due to their Olympic team alternate Rhonda Faehn appearing on the podium for the uneven bars during the duration of [[Kelly Garrison-Funderburk|Kelly Garrison-Steve's]] compulsory [[uneven bars (gymnastics)|uneven bars]] routine, despite not competing, having been caught by the East German judge, Ellen Berger. The US finishes in fourth place after the completion of the optional rounds with a combined score of 390.575, three tenths of a point behind the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. This still remains controversial in the sport of gymnastics, as the US performed better than the East German team and they would've taken the bronze medal in the team competition had they not been penalized or had an inquiry accepted to receive the points back. If they had medaled, it would have also been their first gymnastics medal in the team competition (men or women) and their first gymnastics medal overall on the women's side in a fully attended Olympics (disregarding the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympics]] which were boycotted by the Soviet Union and the East Germans) had the controversy not been visited in the first place.
* Following the controversy involving the US women's team in artistic gymnastics, American gymnast [[Phoebe Mills]] wins an individual bronze medal on the balance beam, shared with Romania's [[Gabriela Potorac]], making history as the first medal (team or individual) ever won by an American woman in artistic gymnastics at a fully attended games (disregarding 1984).
*The [[Soviet Union|USSR (Soviet Union)]] wins their final team gold medals in artistic gymnastics on both the men's and women's sides with scores of 593.350 and 395.475 respectively. The men's team is led by [[Vladimir Artemov]], while [[Elena Shushunova]] leads the women's team.
* [[Lawrence Lemieux]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] sailor in the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn class]], is in second place and poised to win a silver medal when he abandons the race to save an injured competitor. He arrived in 21st place, but was recognized by the IOC with the [[Pierre de Coubertin medal]] honoring his bravery and sacrifice.
* U.S. diver [[Greg Louganis]] wins back-to-back titles on both diving events, but only after hitting the springboard with his head in the 3&nbsp;m event final.  This became a minor controversy years later when Louganis revealed he knew he was HIV-positive at the time, and did not tell anybody. Since HIV cannot survive in open water, no other divers were ever in danger.
* [[Christa Luding-Rothenburger]] of [[East Germany]] becomes the first (and only) athlete to win Olympic medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] and Summer Olympics in the same year. She adds a cycling silver to the [[speed skating]] gold she won earlier in the [[1988 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics of that year]] in [[Calgary]].<ref name="Christa Luding-Rothenburger Encyclopædia Britannica article">{{cite web

Live doves were released during the Opening Ceremony as a symbol of world peace, but a number of the doves were burned alive or suffered major trauma by the lighting of the Olympic cauldron.

==Significance of the 1988 Olympics in South Korea==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
[[File:Seoul.Olympic.Stadium.01 copy.jpg|thumb|The [[Seoul Olympic Stadium]] seen from [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], [[Seoul]].]]
Hosting the 1988 Olympics presented an opportunity to bring international attention to South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Horton|first1=Peter|last2=Saunders|first2=John|title=The 'East Asian' Olympic Games: what of sustainable legacies?|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&sid=f83ad522-f1e7-4059-ae69-642db2e7f2c2%40sessionmgr4003&hid=4109&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=s3h&AN=75273953|publisher=Taylor and Francis|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The idea for South Korea to place a bid for the 1988 Games emerged during the last days of the [[Park Chung-hee]] administration in the late 1970s.  After President Park’s assassination in 1979, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], his successor, submitted Korea’s bid to the IOC in September 1981, in hopes that the increased international exposure brought by the Olympics would legitimize his authoritarian regime amidst increasing political pressure for democratization, provide protection from increasing threats from [[North Korea]], and showcase the [[Miracle on the Han River|Korean economic miracle]] to the world community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Manheim|first1=Jarol|title=Rites of Passage: The 1988 Seoul Olympics as Public Diplomacy|publisher=Western Political Science Association|pages=279–295|url=http://www.jstor.org.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/stable/448367|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> South Korea was awarded the bid on 30 September 1981, becoming the 20th nation (16th in the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]]), the second Asian nation (following Japan in the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]).

In an attempt to follow the model of 1964 Tokyo Olympics as a rite of passage for the Japanese economy and re-integration of Japan in the family of nations in the post-war era, the South Korean government hoped to use the Olympics as a "coming-out party" for the newly industrialized Korean economy. The South Korean government hoped the Olympics would symbolize a new legitimacy of Korea in world affairs. The Olympics gave a powerful impetus to the development of South Korea's relations with Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and with China.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Ji-Hyun|last2=Bairner|first2=Alan|title=The sociocultural legacy of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games|doi=10.1080/02614367.2011.636178|publisher=Taylor and Francis}}</ref>

As [[June Democracy Movement|political demonstrations emerged in June 1987]], the possibility of jeopardizing hosting the Olympic Games contributed to the 29 June declaration which issued President Chun out of power and led to direct elections in December 1987.  The desire not to taint the Olympic Games with military dictatorship and riots served as an impetus for Korea’s transition to democracy. [[Roh Tae-woo]] served as the transitional president, directly elected by South Koreans in December 1987.

==1988 Summer Olympics boycott==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
In preparation for the 1988 Olympics, the [[International Olympic Committee]]  worked to prevent another Olympic boycott by the [[Eastern Bloc]] as had happened at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]]. This was made more difficult by the lack of diplomatic relations between South Korea and communist countries. This prompted action by the IOC president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], who was committed to the participation of these countries. Thus, at the Assembly of National Olympic Committees in Mexico City in November 1984, the "Mexico Declaration" [http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1984/ore206/ORE206e.pdf] was adopted; by it, the participants agreed to include the host of the Olympic Games in 1988.{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} The agreement of the Soviet Union brought a pledge of equal participation. However, various communist [[National Olympic Committee]]s reacted with incomprehension.{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} After the Los Angeles games, [[East Germany]] had already decided to participate again in Seoul. The IOC also decided that it would send invitations to the 1988 Games itself and did not leave this task to the organizing committee as had been done before. Despite these developments, behind the scenes, the IOC did consider relocating the Games and explored the suitability of [[Munich]] as an alternative.

Another point of conflict was the involvement of [[North Korea]] in hosting the Games, something that had been encouraged by Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]], who called for North Korea to be considered joint host of the Games. As a result, on 8 and 9 January 1986 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], the IOC President chaired a meeting of the North and South Korean Olympic Committees. North Korea demanded that eleven of the 23 Olympic sports be carried out on its territory, and also demanded special opening and closing ceremonies. It wanted a joint organizing committee and a united team. The negotiations were continued into another meeting, but were not successful. The IOC did not meet the demands of North Korea and only about half of the desired sporting events were offered to the North. So the focus thereafter was solely on Seoul and South Korea.<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/nkidp-e-dossier-no-3-sport-and-politics-the-korean-peninsula-north-korea-and-the-1988 "Sport and Politics on the Korean Peninsula – North Korea and the 1988 Seoul Olympics"] NKIDP e-Dossier No. 3. Retrieved 23 April 2012</ref>

North Korea boycotted the Games after the failed negotiations and was supported by [[Cuba]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Ethiopia]]. [[Albania]] and the [[Seychelles]] also did not attend, but, in order to avoid sanctions by the IOC, did not call their absence a boycott. The participation of [[Madagascar]] had been expected, and their team was expected at the opening ceremony of 160 nations. However, the country joined the North Korean boycott.<ref>[[:de:Olympische Sommerspiele 1988#Sportpolitik]]</ref>

{{main|Hand in Hand (Olympic theme song)}}
In 1988, the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee (SLOOC) decided to produce and distribute an official song of the Seoul Games to publicize the Games to all the IOC member nations, encouraging their participation in the festival and
consolidating the harmony and friendship of the entire world citizens through the song. The song "[[Hand in Hand (Olympics)|Hand in Hand]]" was written by Italian composer [[Giorgio Moroder]] and American songwriter [[Tom Whitlock]], and performed by singing group Koreana. "Hand in Hand" topped popular songs in 17 countries including Sweden, Federal Rep. Of Germany, the Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Japan and Hong Kong and was listed
among the top 10s of the popular songs in more than 30 countries.
