The '''1992 Summer Olympic Games''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Juegos Olímpicos de Verano de 1992''; [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Jocs Olímpics d'estiu de 1992''), officially known as the '''Games of the XXV Olympiad''', was an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] played in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]] in 1992. Beginning in 1994, the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided to hold the games in alternating even-numbered years; as a result, [[the 1992 Summer Olympics]] were the last competition to be staged in the same year as the [[Winter Olympic games|Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Winter/Albertville-1992/|title=Albertville 1992|publisher=www.olympic.org|accessdate=March 12, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328115821/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Winter/Albertville-1992/| archivedate= 28 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> The games were the first to be unaffected by boycotts since 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/barcelona-1992-summer-olympics |title=Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics &#124; Olympic Videos, Photos, News |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref>

== Host city selection ==
Barcelona is the second-largest city in Spain, and the birthplace of then-[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]]. The city was also host for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]. On October 17, 1986, Barcelona was selected to host the 1992 Summer Games over [[Amsterdam]], [[Belgrade]], [[Birmingham]], [[Brisbane]], and [[Paris]], during the 91st [[IOC Session]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html |title=IOC Vote History |publisher=Aldaver.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref> Barcelona had previously bid for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], but they ultimately lost to [[Berlin]].

== Highlights ==
[[File:Dream Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics.JPEG|right|thumb|175px|The 1992 Summer Olympics allowed [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players to participate in the basketball competition for the first time; here [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] shoots a free throw for the gold-medal winning [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|United States "Dream Team".]]]]
* At the Opening Ceremony Greek mezzo-soprano, [[Agnes Baltsa]], sang "Romiossini" as the Olympic flag was taken around the stadium.  [[Alfredo Kraus]] later sang the Olympic Hymn in both Catalan and Spanish as the flag was hoisted. 
* The Olympic flame cauldron was lit by a flaming arrow, shot by [[Paralympic]] archer [[Antonio Rebollo]]. The arrow had been lit by the flame of the Olympic Torch. Rebollo overshot the cauldron<ref>http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1992/07/27/pagina-36/33525453/pdf.html</ref> as this was the original design of the lighting scheme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics2000/926190.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ceremonial hall of shame | date=2000-09-15 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s4.pdf Official Report of the 1992 Summer Olympics, Vol. 4 (LA84Foundation.org)].

* South Africa was allowed to compete in the Olympic Games for the first time since the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], after a long suspension for its [[apartheid]] policy. After a close race in the Women's 10,000 metres event, white South African runner [[Elana Meyer]] and black [[Ethiopia]]n runner [[Derartu Tulu]] (winner) ran a victory lap together, hand-in-hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1992 |title=Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics &#124; Olympic Videos, Photos, News |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref>
* Following its [[German reunification|reunification]] in 1990, Germany sent a single, unified Olympic team for the first time since the [[1964 Summer Olympics]].
* As the [[Soviet Union]] had been dissolved in 1991, the Baltic nations of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] sent their own teams for the first time since 1936. The other Soviet republics competed under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team.]] These nations consisted of present-day [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Uzbekistan]].
* The separation of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] led to the Olympic debuts of [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Due to [[United Nations]] sanctions, [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal Republic Yugoslavian]] athletes were not allowed to participate with their own team. However, some individual athletes competed under the Olympic flag as [[Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Participants]].
* [[Fermín Cacho]] won the [[1500 metres|1,500 metres]] in his home country, earning Spain's first-ever Olympic gold medal in a running event.<ref>[http://www.olympic.org/fermin-cacho-ruiz Fermin Cacho Ruiz], Olympic.org. Retrieved 25 August 2013</ref>
* [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[diving|diver]] [[Fu Mingxia]], age 13, became the youngest Olympic gold medalist of all time.
* In men's [[artistic gymnastics]], [[Vitaly Scherbo]] from [[Belarus]], (representing the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]]), won six gold medals, including four in a single day. Scherbo tied [[Eric Heiden]]'s record for individual gold medals at a single Olympics, winning five medals in an individual event. ([[Michael Phelps]] would later break this record in [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]).
* In women's artistic gymnastics, [[Tatiana Gutsu]] took gold in the All-Around competition edging the United States' [[Shannon Miller]].
* Russian swimmers dominated the freestyle events, with [[Alexander Popov (swimmer)|Alexander Popov]] and [[Yevgeny Sadovyi]] each winning two events. Sadovyi also won in the relays.
* [[Evelyn Ashford]] won her fourth Olympic gold medal in the 4×100-metre relay, making her one of only four female athletes to have achieved this in history.
* The young [[Krisztina Egerszegi]] of [[Hungary]] won three individual swimming gold medals.
* In women's 200 metre [[breaststroke]], [[Kyoko Iwasaki]] of [[Japan]] won a gold medal at age of 14 years and six days, making her the youngest-ever gold medalist in swimming competitions at the Olympics.
* After demonstrated in six previous Summer Olympic Games, [[baseball]] officially became an Olympic sport. [[Badminton]] and women's [[judo]] also became part of the Olympic program, while [[slalom canoeing]] returned to the Games after a 20-year absence.
* [[Roller hockey (Quad)|Roller hockey]], [[basque pelota]], and [[taekwondo]] were all demonstrated at the 1992 Summer Olympics.
* Several of the U.S. men's volleyball gold medal team from the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] returned to vie for another medal. In the first round, they lost a controversial match to Japan, sparking them to shave their heads in protest. This notably included player [[Steve Timmons]], sacrificing his trademark red [[flattop]] for the protest.
* [[Mike Stulce]] of the United States won the men's [[shot put]], beating the heavily favored [[Werner Günthör]] of Switzerland.
* On the 20th anniversary of the [[Munich massacre]] and the 500th anniversary of the [[Alhambra Decree]], [[Yael Arad]] became the first [[Israel]]i to win an Olympic medal, winning a silver medal in judo. The next day, [[Oren Smadja]] became Israel's first male medalist, winning a bronze in the same sport.
* [[Derek Redmond]] of Great Britain tore a hamstring during a 400-meter semi-final heat. As he struggled to finish the race, his father entered the track without credentials and helped him complete the race, to a [[standing ovation]] from the crowd.
* [[Gail Devers]] won the 100-meter dash in one of the closest races in history. Five women finished within 0.06 seconds of each other. In the 100 meter hurdles, Devers was a clear favorite to win, though finished in fifth place when she hit the final hurdle and stumbled over the finish line. [[Voula Patoulidou]] from Greece won the event.
* In [[basketball]], the admittance of professional players led to the formation of the "[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]" of the United States, featuring [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Larry Bird]] and other [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] stars. The Dream Team, which easily won the gold medal, would be inducted as a unit into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers: 1992 United States Olympic Team|url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/1992-united-states-olympic-team|website=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref>
* [[Jennifer Capriati]] won the single's tennis competition at the age of 16. She had previously earned a spot in the semifinals of two grand slams at the age of 14.
* Two gold medals were awarded in solo synchronized swimming after a judge inadvertently entered the score of "8.7" instead of the intended "9.7" in the computerized scoring system for one of [[Sylvie Fréchette]]'s figures. This error ultimately placed Fréchette second, leaving [[Kristen Babb-Sprague]] for the gold medal. Though immediate protests to [[FINA]] were unsuccessful, FINA awarded Fréchette a gold medal in December 1993, replacing her silver medal and leaving the two swimmers both with gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/events/1996/olympics/daily/july30/frec.html |title=On the Bright Side |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=1996-07-30 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>
* Indonesia won its first-ever gold medal, after winning a silver medal at [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]]. [[Susi Susanti]] won the gold in [[badminton]] women's singles after defeating [[Bang Soo-hyun]] in the final round. [[Alan Budikusuma]] won the badminton men's singles competition, earning a second gold medal for Indonesia. Several years later, Susanti and Budikusuma married and she received the nickname golden bride or Olympic bride.

[[File:1992 Summer olympics team numbers.gif|thumb|Participating countries by number of competitors]]
A total of 169 nations sent athletes to compete in the 1992 Summer Games. 

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], twelve of the fifteen new states formed a [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], while the [[Baltic States]] of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania each had their own teams for the first time since 1936. For the first time, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina competed as independent nations after their [[Dissolution of Yugoslavia|separation from Socialist Yugoslavia]], and [[Namibia]] and the unified team of [[Yemen]] (previously North and South Yemen) also made their Olympic debuts.

The 1992 Summer Olympics notably marked Germany competing as a unified team for the first time since 1964, while South Africa returned to the Games for the first time in 32 years.

The [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was banned due to [[United Nations|UN]] sanctions, but individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as [[Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Participants]]. Four National Olympic Committees did not send any athletes to compete: [[Afghanistan]], [[Brunei]], [[Liberia]] and [[Somalia]].

The celebration of the 1992 Olympic Games had an enormous impact on the urban culture and external projection of Barcelona. The Games provided billions of dollars for infrastructure investments, which are considered to have improved the quality of life and attraction of the city for investment and tourism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://olympicstudies.uab.es/pdf/wp084_eng.pdf |title=The economic impact of the Barcelona Olympic Games 1986-2004|accessdate=2009-06-22|last=Brunet i Cid|first=Ferran|publisher=[[Autonomous University of Barcelona]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iRr55PoO|archivedate=2009-07-21|deadurl=no}}</ref> Barcelona became one of the most visited cities in Europe after [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26042517|title=The Olympics Effect|accessdate=2009-06-22|last=Payne|first=Bob|publisher=msnbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euromonitor.com/Top_150_City_Destinations_London_Leads_the_Way|title=Top 150 City Destinations (2006)|last=Bremner|first=Caroline|publisher=Euromonitor|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jXPv1A7R|archivedate=2009-09-04|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref>

Barcelona's nomination for the 1992 Summer Games sparked the application of a previously elaborated ambitious urban plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://olympicstudies.uab.es/pdf/od006_eng.pdf |title=An economic analysis of the Barcelona'92 Olympic Games:resources, financing and impact|accessdate=2009-06-22|last=Brunet i Cid|first=Ferran|publisher=[[Autonomous University of Barcelona]]}}</ref> Barcelona opened to the sea with the construction of the Olympic Village and Olympic Port in [[El Poblenou|Poblenou]]. New centres were created, and modern sports facilities were built in the Olympic zones of [[Montjuïc]], [[Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona|Diagonal]], and [[La Vall d'Hebron|Vall d'Hebron]]. Hotels were also either built or refurbished. The construction of ring roads around the city helped reduce the density of the traffic, and [[Barcelona Airport|El Prat airport]] was modernized and expanded as two new terminals were opened.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23933816-the-olympic-legacy-lessons-of-barcelona-on-thames-1992-games-provided-model-for-london-and-a-few-warnings.do|title=Lessons of Barcelona: 1992 Games provided model for London... and few warnings|last=Beard|first=Matthew|publisher=London Evening Standard|date=2011-03-22|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref>

=== Cost and cost overrun ===
The 1992 Summer Olympics cost Barcelona a total of USD 11.4 billion (in 2009 dollars), with a cost overrun of 417 percent in real terms. This compares with an average cost of USD 5.7 billion (in 2009 dollars) for other Summer Olympics over the past 50 years, with an average cost overrun of 252 percent. Costs here includes only sports-related costs and does not include other public costs including road, rail, or airport infrastructure; and private costs, such as hotel upgrades or other business investments incurred during the preparation for the Games. Though the non-sports-related costs are typically substantial, their necessity varies drastically from city to city. Therefore, they are difficult to compare consistently.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|author2=Allison Stewart|title=Olympic Proportions: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Olympics 1960-2012|journal=Working Paper|year=2012|volume=Saïd Business School, University of Oxford}}</ref>

== Songs and themes ==
There were two main musical themes for the 1992 Games. One was "[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury song)|Barcelona]]", composed five years earlier by [[Freddie Mercury]] and sung as a duet with [[Montserrat Caballé]]. Due to Mercury's death eight months earlier, the duo was unable to perform the song during the opening ceremony. A recording of the song instead played over a travelogue of the city at the start of the opening ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdksitehDJ8&feature=related |title=Barcelona 92: inicio de la ceremonia |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>  
"[[Amigos Para Siempre]]" (''Friends for Life'') was the other musical theme. It was written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]], and sung by [[Sarah Brightman]] and [[José Carreras]] during the closing ceremonies.

[[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] composed and conducted the opening ceremony musical score.<ref>{{cite web|last=Illness |first=Critical |url=http://doreendagostinomedia.com/ryuichi-sakamoto-and-decca/ |title=Doreen D'Agostino Media » Ryuichi Sakamoto and Decca |publisher=Doreendagostinomedia.com |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> The Opening Olympic fanfare was composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] and with orchestrations by Joseph Turrin.

== Mascot ==
{{main|Cobi}}
The official [[mascot]] was '''Cobi''', a [[Catalan Sheepdog|Catalan sheepdog]] in [[Cubism|cubist]] style designed by [[Javier Mariscal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barcelona 1992 - Summer Games Mascots|url=http://www.olympic.org/barcelona-1992-mascot|website=Olympic.org|publisher=IOC|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref>

== Corporate image and identity ==
A renewal in Barcelona's image and corporate identity could be seen in the publication of posters, commemorative coins, stamps minted by the [[Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre – Real Casa de la Moneda|FNMT]] in Madrid, and the [[Barcelona 1992 Olympic Official Commemorative Medals]], designed and struck in Barcelona.
