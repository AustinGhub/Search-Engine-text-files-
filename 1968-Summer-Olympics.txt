The '''1968 Summer Olympics''' (Spanish: ''Juegos Olímpicos de Verano de 1968''), officially known as the '''Games of the XIX Olympiad''', were an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] held in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], in October 1968.

These were the first [[Olympic Games]] to be staged in [[Latin America]] and the first to be staged in a [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] country. They were also the first Games to be held in a developing country (previously, all Olympic Games had been held in [[First World]] countries).  They were also the first Games to use an all-weather (hard) track for [[track and field]] events instead of a traditional cinder track. 

The 1968 Games were the third to be held in [[autumn]], after the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Games in Melbourne]] and the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games in Tokyo]]. The [[Mexico 68|Mexican Student Movement of 1968]] happened concurrently and the Olympic Games were correlated to the government's repression.

==Olympic torch relay==
The [[1968 Summer Olympics torch relay|1968 torch relay]] recreated the route taken by [[Christopher Columbus]] to the [[New World]], journeying from Greece through Italy and Spain to San Salvador Island, Bahamas, and then on to Mexico.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}  American [[sculptor]] [[James Metcalf]], an [[expatriate]] in Mexico, won the commission to forge the [[Olympic torch]] for the 1968 Summer Games.<ref name=independent>{{cite news|first=Adrian|last=Dannatt|title=James Metcalf: US sculptor who led a community of artists and artisans in Mexico |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/james-metcalf-us-sculptor-who-led-a-community-of-artists-and-artisans-in-mexico-6988891.html |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=|date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref>

==Highlights==
* In the medal award ceremony for the men's 200 meter race, [[black American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] (gold) and [[John Carlos]] (bronze) took a stand for [[civil rights]] by raising their [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black-gloved fists]] and wearing black socks in lieu of shoes. The Australian [[Peter Norman]], who had run second, wore an American "civil rights" badge as support to them on the podium. As punishment, the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] banned Smith and Carlos from the Olympic Games for life, and Norman was left off Australia's Olympic team in 1972.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* American (and future professional world's champion) [[George Foreman]] won the gold medal for boxing (Heavyweight Division) by defeating Soviet [[Ionas Chepulis]] via a second round TKO. After the victory, Foreman waved a small American flag as he bowed to the crowd.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* The high [[elevation]] of [[Mexico City]], at {{convert|2240|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Sea level#AMSL|above sea level]], influenced many of the events, particularly in track and field. No other Summer Olympic Games before or since have been held at high elevation. Although a performance reducer for endurance athletes, the thin air contributed to many record-setting jumps, leaps, vaults, and throws, as well as all of the men's track events of 400 meters and less. As a reminder of this fact, one of the promotional articles of these Olympics was a small metallic box labeled "Aire de México" (Air of Mexico), that was "Especial para batir récords" (Special for breaking records).{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* In addition to high elevation, this was the first Olympics to use a synthetic all-weather surface for track and field events; the "Tartan" surface was originally developed by [[3M]] for horse racing, but did not catch on.  The tracks at previous Olympics were conventional [[Cinder track|cinder]].{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* For the first time, [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] competed as separate teams, after being forced by the IOC to compete as a [[United Team of Germany|combined German team]] in 1956, 1960, and 1964.  [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]'' was played when East and West Germany arrived in the stadium.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* [[Al Oerter]] of the U.S. won his fourth consecutive [[gold medal]] in the [[discus throw|discus]] to become only the second athlete to achieve this feat in an individual event, and the first in track & field ([[track and field athletics|athletics]]).{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* [[Bob Beamon]] of the U.S. leapt {{convert|8.90|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[long jump]], an incredible {{convert|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} improvement over the previous world record. It remained the Olympic record and stood as the world record for 23 years, until broken by American [[Mike Powell (athlete)|Mike Powell]] in 1991. American athletes [[Jim Hines]], [[Tommie Smith]] and [[Lee Evans (athlete)|Lee Evans]] also set long-standing world records in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m, respectively.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* In the [[triple jump]], the previous world record was improved five times by three different athletes. [[Viktor Saneev]] won the first of three successive gold medals in this event. He won silver in 1980.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* [[Dick Fosbury]] of the U.S. won the gold medal in the [[high jump]] using his unconventional [[Fosbury flop]] technique, which quickly became the dominant technique in the event.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* [[Věra Čáslavská]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] won four gold medals in [[gymnastics]].{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* [[Debbie Meyer]] of the U.S. became the first swimmer to win three individual gold medals, in the 200, 400 and 800 m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] events. The 800 m was a new long-distance event for women. Meyer was only 16 years old, a student at [[Rio Americano High School]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. Meyer was the first of several American teenagers to win the 800 m.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* American swimmer [[Charlie Hickcox]] won three gold medals (200m IM, 400m IM, 4 × 100 m medley relay) and one silver medal (100m backstroke).{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* The introduction of [[Doping (Sport)|doping]] tests resulted in the first disqualification because of doping: [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]] was disqualified for [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] use (he drank several [[beer]]s just prior to competing).{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* [[John Stephen Akhwari]] of [[Tanzania]] became internationally famous after finishing the marathon, in last place, despite a dislocated knee.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* This was the first of three Olympic participations by [[Jacques Rogge]]. He competed in [[yachting]] and would later become the eighth president of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]].{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* [[Norma Enriqueta Basilio de Sotelo]] of Mexico became the first woman to light the Olympic cauldron with the Olympic flame.{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* It was the first games at which there was a significant African presence in men's distance running. Africans won at least one medal in all running events from 800 meters to the marathon, and in so doing they set a trend for future games. Most of these runners came from high-altitude areas of countries like [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]], and they were well-prepared for the 2240 m elevation of [[Mexico City]].{{citation needed|date = February 2015}}
* It was the first Olympic games in which the closing ceremony was transmitted in color to the world, as well as the events themselves.<ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/first-summer-olympic-games-to-be-televised-in-colour/ Guinness World Records - First summer Olympic Games to be televised in colour]</ref>

==Controversies==

===South Africa===
{{Main article|Apartheid South Africa and the Olympics#1965–68}}
South Africa was provisionally invited to the Games, on the understanding that all segregation and discrimination in sport would be eliminated by the 1972 Games. However, African countries and black American athletes promised to boycott the Games if South Africa was present, and Eastern Bloc countries threatened to do likewise. In April 1968 the IOC conceded that "it would be most unwise for South Africa to participate".<ref>{{cite book |last=Espy |first=Richard |title=The Politics of the Olympic Games: With an Epilogue, 1976-1980 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEA_Ss_2wK0C&pg=PA125 |pages=125–8 |accessdate=16 June 2013 |year=1981 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520043954 }}</ref>

===Tlatelolco massacre===
{{Main article|Tlatelolco massacre}}
Responding to growing social unrest and protests, the government of Mexico had increased economic and political suppression, against [[labor union]]s in particular, in the decade building up to the Olympics. A series of protest marches in the city in August gathered significant attendance, with an estimated 500,000 taking part on August 27. President [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] ordered the occupation{{by whom|date=February 2015}} of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in September, but protests continued. Using the prominence brought by the Olympics, students gathered in [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] to call for greater civil and democratic rights and showed disdain for the Olympics with slogans such as ''¡No queremos olimpiadas, queremos revolución!'' ("We don't want Olympics, we want revolution!").<ref>[http://www.adnpolitico.com/2012/2012/08/07/mexico-1968-las-olimpiadas-10-dias-despues-de-la-matanza México 1968: Las Olimpiadas 10 días después de la matanza].

Ten days before the start of the Olympics, the government ordered the gathering in Plaza de las Tres Culturas to be broken up. Some 5000 soldiers and 200 [[tankette]]s surrounded the plaza. Hundreds of protesters and civilians were killed and over 1000 were arrested. At the time, the event was portrayed in the national media as the military suppression of a violent student uprising, but later analysis indicates that the gathering was peaceful prior to the army's advance.<ref>Werner, Michael S., ed.

===Black Power salute===
{{Main article|1968 Olympics Black Power salute}}

On October 16, 1968, black American sprinters [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], the gold and bronze medalists in the men's 200-meter race, took their places on the podium for the medal ceremony wearing black socks without shoes and civil rights badges, lowered their heads and each defiantly [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]] as the ''[[Star Spangled Banner]]'' was played in solidarity with the Black Freedom Movement in the United States. Both were members of the [[Olympic Project for Human Rights]]. Some people (particularly IOC president [[Avery Brundage]]) felt that a political statement had no place in the international forum of the Olympic Games. In an immediate response to their actions, Smith and Carlos were suspended from the U.S. team by Brundage and banned from the Olympic Village. Those who opposed the protest said the actions disgraced all Americans. Supporters, on the other hand, praised the men for their bravery.

[[Peter Norman]], the Australian sprinter who came second in the 200 m race, also wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge during the medal ceremony. Norman was the one who suggested that Carlos and Smith wear one glove each. His actions resulted in him being ostracized by Australian media<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike|last=Wise|title=Clenched fists, helping hand|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100401753_2.html|work=The Washington Post|date=5 October 2006|accessdate=9 November 2008}}</ref> and a reprimand by his country's Olympic authorities, who did not send him or any other male sprinters at all to the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 games]] (despite easily making the qualifying time).<ref name="BBC2">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm |publisher=BBC | title=The other man on the podium | accessdate=9 November 2008 | date=17 October 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026023952/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm| archivedate= 26 October 2008| first=Caroline | last=Frost}}</ref> When Australia hosted the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], he was not invited to join other Australian medallists at the opening ceremony.

=== Věra Čáslavská ===
In another incident, while standing on the medal podium after the  balance beam event final where [[Natalia Kuchinskaya]] of the [[Soviet Union]] had controversially taken the Gold, [[Czechoslovakia]]n [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Věra Čáslavská]] quietly turned her head down and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem. The action was Čáslavská's silent protest against the recent [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]], and was repeated when she accepted her medal for her floor exercise routine when the judges changed the preliminary scores of the Soviet [[Larisa Petrik]] to tie with Čáslavská. While Čáslavská's countrymen supported her actions and her outspoken opposition to Communism (she had publicly signed and supported [[Ludvik Vaculik]]'s "[[The Two Thousand Words|Two Thousand Words]]" manifesto), the new regime responded by banning her from both sporting events and international travel for many years and made her an outcast from society.

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
[[Image:1968 Summer Olympic games countries.png|thumb|240px|Participants]]  [[File:1968 Summer olympics team numbers.gif|thumb|Number of athletes per country]] <!--the coloring of the map doesn't align with the text's list of new countries; in addition, if E.Germany is blue, shouldn't W.Germany be, too, as they were competing separately?-->
[[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]] competed as separate entities for the first time in at a Summer Olympiad, and would remain so through 1988.  [[Barbados]] competed for the first time as an independent country.
Also competing for the first time in a Summer Olympiad were [[British Honduras]] (now [[Belize]]), [[Central African Republic]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (as Congo-Kinshasa), [[El Salvador]], [[Guinea]], [[Honduras]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Sierra Leone]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands]].
[[Singapore]] returned to the Games as an independent country after competing as part of the Malaysian team in 1964. [[Suriname]] actually competed for the first time (in 1960 its lone athlete withdrew from competition due to a scheduling error.)
