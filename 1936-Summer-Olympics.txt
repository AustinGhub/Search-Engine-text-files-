The '''1936 Summer Olympics''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Olympische Sommerspiele 1936''), officially known as the '''Games of the XI Olympiad''', was an international [[multi-sport event]] that was held in 1936 in [[Berlin]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over [[Barcelona]], [[Second Spanish Republic|Spain]], on 26 April 1931, at the 29th [[IOC Session]] in Barcelona (two years before the [[Nazis]] came to power). It marked the second and final time the [[International Olympic Committee]] gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games. 

To outdo the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles games of 1932]], Germany built [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium]], six gymnasiums, and many other smaller arenas. The games were the first to be [[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow|televised]], and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries.<ref name="ReferenceA">Rader, Benjamin G. "American Sports: From the Age of Folk Games to the Age of Televised Sports" --5th Ed.</ref> Filmmaker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Her film, titled ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports.

Reich Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]] saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy, and the official Nazi party paper, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games.<ref name="Hitlerland. p. 188">''Hitlerland''. p. 188.</ref><ref name="David Clay Large p. 58">David Clay Large, ''Nazi Games: The Olympics of 1936'', p. 58.</ref> However, when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, he relented and allowed all ethnicities to participate.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Total ticket revenues were 7.5 million [[German Reichsmark|Reichsmark]], generating a profit of over one million marks. The official budget did not include [[outlay]]s by the city of Berlin (which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5 million marks) or outlays of the German national government (which did not make its costs public, but is estimated to have spent US$30 million).<ref name=Zarnowski>{{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C.

[[Jesse Owens]] won four gold medals in the sprint and [[long jump]] events and became the most successful athlete to compete in Berlin while the [[Nazi Germany|host country]] was the most successful country overall with 89 medals total, with the [[United States]] coming in second with 56 medals. These were the final Olympics under the presidency of [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]]  and the Final Olympic Games for 12 years because of [[World War II]]. The next Olympic Games would be held in [[1948 Summer Olympics |1948]] in London.

The bidding for these Olympic Games was the first to be contested by IOC members casting votes for their own favorite host cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html | title=Olympic Vote History| accessdate=1 July 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525070757/http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html| archivedate= 25 May 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref> The vote occurred in 1931, during the [[Weimar Republic]], before [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] rose to power in 1933. Many other cities around the world also wanted to host the Summer Olympics for that year, but except for [[Barcelona]] they did not receive any IOC votes. The other cities competing to hold the games were [[Alexandria]], Barcelona, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Cologne]], [[Dublin]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Helsinki]], [[Lausanne]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Budapest]], and [[Rome]].<ref name=votes />

The selection procedure marked the second and final time that the [[International Olympic Committee]] would gather to vote in a city which was bidding to host those Games. The only other time this occurred was at the inaugural IOC Session in Paris, France, on 24 April 1894. Then, [[Athens]] and Paris were chosen to host the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Games]], respectively.
Academics cannot agree whether the IOC during this period was a willing collaborator or an organisation that favoured the aesthetics of [[fascism|fascist governments]].<ref name="mega" /> Although the IOC was insulated from the reality of [[Nazism]], elements of Hitler's regime subscribed to the sporting ideologies of the IOC.<ref name="mega">{{cite book|last=Roche|first=Maurice |title=Mega-events and Modernity: Olympics and Expos in the Growth of Global Culture|publisher=Taylor & Francis (US)|year=2000|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RISFAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=Megaevents%20and%20Modernity%3A%20Olympics%20and%20Expos%20in%20the%20Growth%20of%20Global%20Culture&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=effete&f=false 119–121]|ISBN=978-0-415-15712-4}}</ref>

After the Nazis took control and began instituting anti-Semitic policies, the IOC held private discussions among its delegates about changing the decision to hold the Games in Berlin. However, Hitler's regime gave assurances that Jewish athletes would be allowed to compete on a German Olympic team. In September 1934, the [[United States Olympic Committee|US Olympic committee]] publicly accepted the invitation to go to the Berlin games, halting any further IOC attempts to quietly revise the decision.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Mario|last= Keßler|title= Berlin 1936 – nur Spiele der Nazis?

The next scheduled [[1940 Summer Olympics|games in 1940]] were awarded to Tokyo. The Japanese military even demanded that venues should be built from wood because metal was needed for its [[Second Sino-Japanese War|wars]] in [[Manchuria]].<ref>橋本一夫『幻の東京オリンピック』（日本放送出版協会、1994年） ISBN 4-14-001709-0</ref> The [[Olympic torch relay]] – itself pioneered as part of the 1936 Summer Games – was to fly the [[Olympic flame]] from Berlin to Tokyo in a specially-designed [[Messerschmitt Me 261|long-range aircraft]].<ref>{{cite book |title=German Combat Planes: A Comprehensive Survey and History of the Development of German Military Aircraft from 1914 to 1945 |last1=Wagner |first1=Ray |last2=Nowarra |first2=Heinz |authorlink= |year=1971 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York City |isbn= |page=312 |pages= |url=|accessdate= }}</ref> In 1938 the Japanese rejected hosting the games because they saw the Olympics and its [[Pacifism|pacifist values]] as 'an effete form of European culture'.<ref name="mega" />

== Organization ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-116-08A, Olympische Spiele, Fackelläufer.jpg|thumb|Runners carrying the Olympic Flame.]]
[[Hans von Tschammer und Osten]], as ''Reichssportführer'', i.e. head of the [[Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen|Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen]] (DRL), the Reich Sports Office, played a major role in the structure and organisation of the Olympics. He promoted the idea that the use of sports would harden the German spirit and instill unity among German youth. At the same time he also believed that sports was a "way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables."<ref>{{cite web|title=Nazification of Sport|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/olympics/detail.php?content=sports|website=www.ushmm.org|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=16 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607115150/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/olympics/detail.php?content=sports|archivedate=7 June 2013}}</ref>

Von Tschammer trusted the details of the organisation of the games to Theodor Lewald and [[Carl Diem]], the former president and secretary of the ''Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen'', the forerunner of the Reich Sports Office. Among Diem's ideas for the Berlin Games was the introduction of the [[Olympic flame|Olympic torch relay]] between [[Greece]] and the host nation.

=== Torch relay ===
{{Main|1936 Summer Olympics torch relay}}

The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the [[List of Olympic torch relays|first of its kind]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7330949.stm|title=The Olympic torch's shadowy past|publisher=''[[BBC News]]|date=5 April 2008}}</ref> following on from the reintroduction of the [[Olympic Flame]] at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Games]]. It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from [[Greece]] to the Olympic venue. [[Leni Riefenstahl]] filmed the relay for the award-winning but controversial 1938 film ''Olympia''.

=== Broadcasting ===
[[File:Olympia-Kanone 1936.jpg|thumb|TV camera from Telefunken.]]

The games were the first to have [[live television]] coverage. The German Post Office, using equipment from [[Telefunken]], broadcast over 70 hours of coverage to special viewing rooms throughout Berlin and [[Potsdam]] and a few private TV sets, transmitting from the [[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow|Paul Nipkow TV Station]]. Unfortunately, they were using three different types of TV cameras, so blackouts would occur when changing from one type to another. Also, the quality was generally poor. As one New York journalist said "...Only the polo game show up fairly clearly when black or chestnut ponies are used."<ref>{{cite book|last=Large|first=Davic Clay|title=Nazi Games The Olympics of 1936|year=2007|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.|isbn=0-393-05884-0}}</ref> The [[Olympic Flame]] was used for the third time at these games, but this marked the first time it was brought to the [[Olympic Village]] by a [[Olympic torch relay|torch relay]], with the starting point in [[Olympia, Greece]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1252770 |title=Olympic Flame history |accessdate=23 August 2008 |quote=The carrying of the flame from its origin in Olympia to the site of the games is called the Olympic Torch Relay. Some believe that the relay also began in the Ancient Olympics, but Olympic officials confirm that the tradition of the Modern Olympic Torch Relay began in 1936 at the Berlin Games, to represent a link between the ancient and modern Olympics, and has since remained as an Olympic custom. |publisher=[[Everything2]] }}</ref>

=== Olympic village ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P019183, Berlin, Olympisches Dorf.jpg|thumb|The Olympic village.]]

The Olympic village was located at Estal in [[Wustermark]], (at {{nowrap|{{coord| 52|32|10.78|N| 13| 0|33.20|E|scale:8000|display=inline}}}}), on the western edge of Berlin. The site, which was {{convert|30|km}} from the centre of the city, consisted of one and two-floor dormitories, dining areas, a swimming pool, and training facilities. During the [[Second World War]], it was used as a hospital for injured ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' soldiers. In 1945 it was taken over by the [[Soviet Union]] and became a military camp of the union occupation forces. Recent efforts have been made to restore parts of the former village, but to no avail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2165435/Adolf-Hitlers-Olympic-Village-1936-Can-decaying-relic-escape-ghosts-past.html|title=Adolf Hitler's Olympic Village of 1936: Can this decaying relic ever escape the ghosts of its past?|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=30 June 2012}}</ref> Efforts are being made to restore the site into a living museum. The dormitory building used by [[Jesse Owens]] has been fully restored, and tours are given daily to small groups and students.

The site remains relatively unknown even in Germany, but some tournaments are held at the site in an effort to boost knowledge of the venues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/hitler-olympic-village-faces-conservation-battle/1494715.html|title=Hitler's Olympic Village Faces Conservation Battle |publisher=Voice of America|date=26 August 2012}}</ref>

== Games ==

=== Opening ceremony ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P017045, Berlin, Eröffnung der XI. Olympischen Spiele.jpg|thumb|left|Parade of nations]]

The opening ceremony was held at the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Berlin Olympic Stadium]]. After the parade of nations and a speech by the president of the German Olympic Committee, the games were declared open by Adolf Hitler. Writer [[Thomas Wolfe]], who was there, described the opening as an "almost religious event, the crowd screaming, swaying in unison and begging for Hitler. There was something scary about it; his cult of personality."<ref name= owensdoc>''Jesse Owens''. TV documentary. [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]. 2012. Presented on [[YLE]] TV 1, 9 July 2014.</ref>

Hitler opened the games from his own box, on top of others. Writer [[David Wallechinsky]] has commented the event by saying that "This was his event, he wanted to be glorified."<ref name= owensdoc />

Though the [[Olympic flame]] was first introduced in the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in Amsterdam, this was the first instance of the torch relay. The Nazis invented the concept of the torch run from ancient [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] to the host city. Thus as swimmer [[Iris Cummings]] Critchell later related, "once the athletes were all in place, the torch bearer ran in through the tunnel to go around the stadium". A young man chosen for this task ran up the steps all the way up to the top of the stadium there to light a cauldron which would start this eternal flame that would burn through the duration of the games.<ref name= owensdoc /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/sports/olympics/14torch.html?ex=1207972800&en=732b3844bc19c839&ei=5070 | publisher = The New York Times | work = Sports > Olympics | title = Hitler's Berlin Games Helped Make Some Emblems Popular | date=14 August 2004 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

But in spite all the pomp and ceremony, and the glorification of Hitler, all did not go according to plan, and there was a rather humorous aspect in the opening ceremony. [[Distance runner]] [[Louis Zamperini]], one of the athletes present, related it on camera:<ref name= owensdoc />
{{quote|They released 25,000 pigeons, the sky was clouded with [[pigeon]]s, the pigeons circles overhead, and then they shot a cannon, and they scared the [[Feces|poop]] out of the pigeons, and we had straw hats, flat straw hats, and you could heard the pitter-patter on our straw hats, but we felt sorry for the women, for they got it in their hair, but I mean there were a mass of droppings, and I say it was so funny…}}

=== Notable achievements ===

Germany had a prosperous year in [[Equestrian at the 1936 Summer Olympics|the equestrian events]], winning individual and team gold in all three disciplines, as well as individual silver in dressage. In the cycling match sprint finals, the German [[Toni Merkens]] fouled [[Arie van Vliet]] of the [[Netherlands]]. Instead of being disqualified, he was fined 100 marks and kept his gold. German gymnasts [[Konrad Frey]] and [[Alfred Schwarzmann]] both won three gold medals.

[[Jesse Owens]] won four gold medals in the sprint and [[long jump]] events. His German competitor [[Luz Long]] offered Owens advice after he almost failed to qualify in the long jump and was posthumously awarded the [[Pierre de Coubertin medal]] for sportsmanship. [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Mack Robinson]], brother to [[Jackie Robinson]], won the 200-meter sprint silver medal behind Owens by 0.4 seconds. Although he did not win a medal, future American war hero [[Louis Zamperini]], lagging behind in the 5,000-meter final, made up ground by clocking a 56-second final lap.  This effort caught the attention of [[Adolf Hitler]] who personally commended Zamperini on his speed.  In one of the most dramatic [[800 metres|800-meter]] races in history, American [[John Woodruff]] won gold after slowing to jogging speed in the middle of the final in order to free himself from being boxed in.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/sports/othersports/01woodruff.html?_r=1 | title=John Woodruff, an Olympian, Dies at 92 | first=Frank | last=Litsky | newspaper=The New York Times | date=1 November 2007 | accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> [[Glenn Morris|Glenn Edgar Morris]], a farm boy from Colorado, won Gold in the Decathlon. [[Sport rowing|Rower]] [[Jack Beresford]] won his fifth Olympic medal in the sport, and his third gold medal. The U.S. eight-man rowing team from the [[University of Washington]] won the gold medal, coming from behind to defeat the Germans and Italians with [[Adolf Hitler]] in attendance.

[[File:WoodRuff 1936 Olympics medal back.jpg|thumb|Reverse of [[John Woodruff]]'s gold medal while on display at [[Hillman Library]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]].]]

[[Jack Lovelock]] of New Zealand won the 1500&nbsp;m gold medal, coming through a strong field to win in world record time of 3:47.8.

In the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], Japan won one gold ([[Son Kitei]]) and one bronze ([[Nan Shoryu]]) medal; both the runners were [[Korean people|ethnic Koreans]].

[[India]] won the gold medal in the [[field hockey]] event once again (they won the gold in all Olympics from 1928 to 1956), defeating Germany 8–1 in the final. However, Indians were considered [[Indo-Aryans]] by the Germans and there was no controversy regarding their victory. [[Rie Mastenbroek]] of the [[Netherlands]] won three gold medals and a silver in swimming. [[Estonia]]'s [[Kristjan Palusalu]] won two gold medals in Men's [[Wrestling]], marking the last time Estonia competed as an independent nation in the Olympics until 1992.

After winning the middleweight class, the Egyptian weightlifter [[Khadr El Touni]] continued to compete for another 45 minutes, finally exceeding the total of the German silver medalist by 35&nbsp;kg. The 20-year-old El Touni lifted a total of 387.5&nbsp;kg crushing two German world champions, El Touni broke the then Olympic and world records, while the German lifted 352.5&nbsp;kg. Furthermore, El Touni had lifted 15&nbsp;kg more than the light-heavyweight gold medalist, a feat only El Touni has accomplished. El Touni's new world records stood for 13 years. Fascinated by El Touni's performance, Adolf Hitler rushed down to greet this human miracle. Prior to the competition, Hitler was said to have been sure that [[Rudolf Ismayr]] and Adolf Wagner would embarrass all other opponents. Hitler was so impressed by El Touni's domination in the middleweight class that he ordered a street named after him in Berlin olympic village.<ref name="1936 Olympics book" /> The Egyptian held the No. 1 position on the [[International Weightlifting Federation|IWF]] list of history's 50 greatest weightlifters for 60 years, until the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Games]] in [[Atlanta]] where [[Turkey]]'s [[Naim Süleymanoğlu]] surpassed him to top the list.

[[Italy national soccer team|Italy's football team]] continued their dominance under head coach [[Vittorio Pozzo]], winning the gold medal in these Olympics between their two consecutive [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] victories ([[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]]). Much like the successes of German athletes, this triumph was claimed by supporters of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime as a vindication of the superiority of the fascist system. Austria won the silver; a controversial win after Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount [[Peru]]'s 4–2 win over [[Austria]]. The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games. In the quarter-finals of the [[Association football|football]] tournament, Peru beat Austria 4–2 in extra-time. Peru rallied from a two-goal deficit in the final 15 minutes of normal time. During extra-time, Peruvian fans allegedly ran onto the field and attacked an Austrian player. In the chaos, Peru scored twice and won, 4–2. However, Austria protested and the International Olympic Committee ordered a replay without any spectators. The Peruvian government refused and their entire Olympic squad left in protest as did Colombia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Berlin, 1936|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197041/overview.html|website=www.fifa.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)|accessdate=16 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001150727/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197041/overview.html|archivedate=1 October 2007}}</ref>

A remarkable story from the track and field competition was the gold medal won by the US women's 4 × 100&nbsp;m relay team. The German team were the heavy favourites, but dropped the baton at one hand-off. Of notable interest on the US team was Elizabeth "Betty" Robinson Schwartz.<ref name="anb.org">{{cite web|title=Schwartz, Elizabeth Robinson|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/19/19-00969.html|website=www.anb.org|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> She was the first woman ever awarded an Olympic gold medal for track and field, winning the women's 100&nbsp;m event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.<ref name="anb.org" /> In 1931, Robinson was involved in a plane crash, and was severely injured. Her body was discovered in the wreckage and it was wrongly thought that she was dead. She was placed in the trunk of a car and taken to an undertaker, where it was discovered that she was not dead, but in a coma. She awoke from the coma seven months later, although it was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair, and two years before she could walk normally again.<ref>Joe Gergen (2014) First Lady of Olympic Track: The Life and Times of Betty Robinson, Northwestern University Press, ISBN 0-8101-2958-2, pp. 146–47</ref> Due to the length of her recovery, she had to miss participating in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, in her home country.

=== Participating nations ===
A total of 49 nations attended the Berlin Olympics, up from 37 in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]]. Five nations made their first official Olympic appearance at these Games: [[Afghanistan]], [[Bermuda]], Bolivia, [[Costa Rica]] and Liechtenstein.

== Controversies ==

Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy. The official Nazi party paper, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', wrote in the strongest terms that Jews and Black people should not be allowed to participate in the Games.<ref name="Hitlerland. p. 188" /><ref name="David Clay Large p. 58" /> However, when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, he relented and allowed Black people and Jews to participate, and added one token participant to the German team—a German woman, [[Helene Mayer]], who had a Jewish father.  At the same time, the party removed signs stating "Jews not wanted" and similar slogans from the city's main tourist attractions. In an attempt to "clean up" the host city, the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|German Ministry of the Interior]] authorized the chief of police to arrest all [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsies) and keep them in a "special camp," the [[Berlin-Marzahn concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/olympics/detail.php?content=facade_hospitality_more& |title=The Facade of Hospitality |quote=In a move to "clean up" Berlin before the Olympics, the German Ministry of Interior authorized the chief of the Berlin Police to arrest all Gypsies prior to the Games. On 16 July 1936, some 800 Gypsies were arrested and interned under police guard in a special Gypsy camp in the Berlin suburb of Marzahn. |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate=4 July 2008 }}</ref>

=== Political aspects ===
[[File:Berlin 1936 olympiaden.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Hermann Göring]] watching events.]]

[[United States Olympic Committee]] president [[Avery Brundage]] became a main supporter of the Games being held in Germany, arguing that "politics has no place in sport", despite having initial doubts.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=The Nazi Party: The Nazi Olympics|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/olympics.html|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> Later Brundage requested that a system be established to [[Gender verification in sports|examine female athletes]] for what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called "sex ambiguities" after observing the performance of Czechoslovak runner and jumper Zdenka Koubkova and English shotputter and javelin thrower Mary Edith Louise Weston. (Both individuals later had sex change surgery and legally changed their names to Zdenek Koubek and Mark Weston.).<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicine: Change of Sex|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756527-1,00.html|website=time.com|publisher=TIME Magazine|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>

Despite not coming from a fascist country, French Olympians gave what appeared to be the [[Roman salute]] at the opening ceremony, although some have later claimed that they were just performing the [[Olympic symbols#Olympic salute|Olympic salute]], which was in fact a very similar action.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Berlin Olympics|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/triumph/tr-olympics.htm|website=www.historyplace.com|publisher=The History Place|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>

Although Haiti only attended the opening ceremony, an interesting [[Vexillology|vexillological]] fact was noticed: its [[Flag of Haiti|flag]] and the [[flag of Liechtenstein]] were coincidentally identical, and this was not discovered until then. The following year, a crown was added to Liechtenstein's to distinguish one flag from the other.

American sprinters [[Sam Stoller]] and [[Marty Glickman]], the only two Jews on the U.S. Olympic team, were pulled from the 4 × 100 relay team on the day of the competition, leading to speculation that U.S. Olympic committee leader Brundage did not want to add to Hitler's embarrassment by having two Jews win gold medals.<ref>Holocaust Museum exhibit, Washington, DC</ref>

In 1937, Hollywood released the film ''[[Charlie Chan at the Olympics]]''. The plot concerned members of the [[Ordnungspolizei|Berlin police force]] helping the Chinese detective apprehend a group of spies (of unnamed nationality) from trying to steal a new aerial guidance system. Despite pertaining to the Berlin Olympics, actual Games' footage used by the filmmakers was edited to remove any Nazi symbols.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hanke|first=Ken|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gtpi_b0k5jkC&lpg=PA90&dq=Charlie%20Chan%20at%20the%20Olympics&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q=Charlie%20Chan%20at%20the%20Olympics&f=false |title=Charlie Chan at the Movies: History, Filmography, and Criticism|publisher=McFarland|year=2004|pages=89–97|ISBN=0-7864-1921-0}}</ref>

After the Olympics Jewish participation in German sports was further limited, and persecution of Jews started to become ever more lethal. The Olympic Games had provided a nine months period of relative calmness.<ref>[[Arnd Krüger]]. "Once the Olympics are through, we'll beat up the Jew" German Jewish Sport 1898–1938 and the Anti-Semitic Discourse, in: ''Journal of Sport History'', 1999 Vol. 26 No. 2 p. 353-375. www.library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1999/JSH2602/jsh2602g.pdf</ref>

=== Antisemitism ===

The German Olympic committee, in accordance with Nazi directives, virtually barred Germans who were Jewish or [[Romani people|Roma]] or had such an ancestry from participating in the Games ([[Helene Mayer]] was the only German Jew to compete at the Berlin Games). This decision meant exclusion for many of the country's top athletes such as [[shotputter]] and [[discus thrower]] [[Lilli Henoch]], who was a four-time world record holder and 10-time German national champion,<ref name="google2">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0KzECrIQDQC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=Lilli+Henoch+jewish&source=bl&ots=hs95_fZgsb&sig=ZcJLjRPm4MMxQtH1zSNmXSRiiX0&hl=en&ei=986wTseJNaLv0gGstdi9AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=henoch&f=false |title=Jews and the Olympic Games: the clash between sport and politics: with a complete review of Jewish Olympic medalists |author=Paul Taylor |ISBN=1-903900-88-3|publisher= Sussex Academic Press|year= 2004|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> and [[Gretel Bergmann]] who was suspended from the German team just days after she set a record of 1.60 meters in the high jump.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/sports/german-film-helps-jewish-athlete-right-historical-wrong-1.3472 |title=German film helps Jewish athlete right historical wrong |publisher= Haaretz |date= 25 November 2009|accessdate=19 August 2012|author=Hipsh, Rami}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Richard|last= Sandomir|title='Hitler's Pawn' on HBO: An Olympic Betrayal  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E4D9143BF934A35754C0A9629C8B63 |quote=And she remembers with restrained anger the isolation she felt as a Jewish athlete denied basic rights in Hitler's Germany, and how, despite equaling a national record in the high jump a month before the 1936 Berlin Summer Games, she was excluded from the German Olympic team because she was a Jew. |work=New York Times |date=7 July 2004 |accessdate=4 July 2008}}</ref>

During the Games, ''[[Hauptmann]]'' [[Wolfgang Fürstner]], the commandant of the Olympic Village in [[Wustermark]], was abruptly replaced by ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' [[Werner von Gilsa]], commander of the [[Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland|Berlin Guard-Regiment]]. The official reason given by the Nazis was because Fürstner had not acted "with the necessary energy" after 370,000 visitors had passed through the village – between 1 May to 15 June – causing significant damage to the site. However this reason was just a pretext to disparaging the half-Jewish officer and expediting his removal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Fürstner committed suicide shortly after the conclusion of the Berlin Olympics because he learned the [[Nuremberg Laws]] classified him as a Jew. As such, the career officer was to be expelled from the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehrer|first=Steven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9GIAQAACAAJ&dq=lehrer+chancellery&ei=g_CpSeeyIIzSlQSm7qWVBA |title=The Reich Chancellery and Führerbunker Complex.

Individual Jewish athletes from a number of countries chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics, including South African [[Sid Kiel]],<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/45860.html Players / South Africa / Sid Kiel] – ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 2 May 2015.</ref> and Americans [[Milton Green]] and [[Norman Cahners]]. In the United States, the [[American Jewish Congress]] and the [[Jewish Labor Committee]] supported a boycott.<ref name=USHMM_boycott />

=== Boycott debate ===

Prior to and during the Games, there was considerable debate outside Germany over whether the competition should be allowed or discontinued. Berlin had been selected by the IOC as the host city in 1931, but after [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933, observers in many countries began to question the morality of going ahead with an Olympic Games hosted by the Nazi regime. A number of brief campaigns to boycott or relocate the Games emerged in the United Kingdom, France, [[Sweden]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=USHMM_boycott>{{cite web|title=The Movement to Boycott the Berlin Olympics of 1936|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007087|work=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=8 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095138/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007087|archivedate=2 February 2013|date=June 2013}}</ref> Exiled German political opponents of the Hitler's regime also campaigned against the Berlin Olympics through pro-Communist newspapers such as the ''[[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung]]''.

The protests were ultimately unsuccessful; in 1935 the [[Amateur Athletic Union of the United States]] voted to compete in the Berlin Games and other countries followed suit. Forty-nine teams from around the world participated in the 1936 Games, the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point. However, in Spain, an alternative was organised in the IOC's second choice for a host city, [[Barcelona]], although it was cancelled owing to supervening events.<ref name=USHMM_boycott />

;Spain
{{Main|People's Olympiad}}
The [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish government]] led by the newly elected left-wing [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] boycotted the Games and organized the [[People's Olympiad]] as a parallel event in [[Barcelona]]. Some 6,000 athletes from 49 countries registered. However, the People's Olympiad was aborted because of the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] just one day before the event was due to start, just as thousands of athletes had begun to arrive.

;Soviet Union
The [[Soviet Union]] had never participated in the Olympic Games and boycotted the 1936 summer Olympics. Instead, through the auspices of the [[Red Sport International]], it had participated in a left-wing workers' alternative, the [[Spartakiad]], since 1928. The USSR had intended to attend the People's Olympiad in Barcelona until it was cancelled and did attend the [[1937 Workers' Summer Olympiad]] in Antwerp, [[Belgium]] (both of which were Spartakiad events).<ref>Richard D. Mandell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8CYYYeTT5mEC&pg=PA68&dq=Soviet+Union+1936+olympics%22&hl=en&ei=7fsYTaHsEcyUnQfD3ZH6DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Soviet%20Union%201936%20olympics%22&f=false The Nazi Olympics], University of Illinois Press, 1987, ISBN 0-252-01325-5; p. 68</ref>

;United States
[[File:Brundage at Berlin.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Avery Brundage meeting mayor of Berlin [[Julius Lippert (politician)|Julius Lippert]] and IOC German Secretary Theodor Lewald in 1936]]

Traditionally the USA sent one of the largest teams to the Olympics, and there was a considerable debate over whether the United States should participate in the 1936 Games.<ref name=USHMM_boycott />

Those involved in the debate on whether to boycott the Olympics included [[Ernest Lee Jahncke]], Judge Jeremiah Mahoney, and future [[IOC President]] [[Avery Brundage]]. Some within the United States considered requesting a boycott of the Games, as to participate in the festivity might be considered a sign of support for the Nazi regime and its [[anti-Semitic]] policies. However, others such as Brundage (see below) argued that the Olympic Games should not reflect political views, but rather should be strictly a contest of the greatest athletes.

Avery Brundage, then of the [[United States Olympic Committee]], opposed the boycott, stating that Jewish athletes were being treated fairly and that the Games should continue. Brundage asserted that politics played no role in sports, and that they should never be entwined. Brundage also believed that there was a "Jewish-Communist conspiracy" that existed to keep the United States from competing in the Olympic Games.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> On the subject of Jewish discrimination, he stated, "The very foundation of the modern Olympic revival will be undermined if individual countries are allowed to restrict participation by reason of class, creed, or race."<ref name=USHMM_boycott />

During a fact-finding trip that Brundage went on to Germany in 1934 to ascertain whether German Jews were being treated fairly, Brundage found no discrimination when he interviewed Jews and his Nazi handlers translated for him, and Brundage commiserated with his hosts that he belonged to a sports club in Chicago that did not allow Jews entry, either.<ref>[[Andrew Nagorski|Nagorski, Andrew]]. ''[[Hitlerland: American Eyewitnesses to the Nazi Rise to Power]]''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2012, p. 190.</ref>

Unlike Brundage, Jeremiah Mahoney supported a boycott of the Games. Mahoney, the president of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], led newspaper editors and anti-Nazi groups to protest against American participation in the Berlin Olympics. He contested that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich.

Most African-American newspapers supported participation in the Olympics. The Philadelphia ''Tribune'' and the ''[[The Chicago Defender|Chicago Defender]]'' both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The [[American Jewish Congress]] and the [[Jewish Labor Committee]] staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Eventually, Brundage won the debate, convincing the Amateur Athletic Union to close a vote in favor of sending an American team to the Berlin Olympics. Mahoney's efforts to incite a boycott of the Olympic games in the United States failed.

US President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and his administration did not become involved in the debate due to a tradition of allowing the US Olympic Committee to operate independently of government influence. However, several American diplomats including [[William E. Dodd]], the American ambassador to Berlin, and [[George Messersmith]], head of the US legation in Vienna, deplored the US Olympic Committee's decision to participate in the games.<ref name=USHMM_boycott />
