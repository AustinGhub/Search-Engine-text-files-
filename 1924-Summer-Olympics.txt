The '''1924 Summer Olympics''' ({{lang-fr|Les Jeux olympiques d'été de 1924}}), officially known as the '''Games of the VIII Olympiad''', were an international [[multi-sport event]] which was celebrated in 1924 in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It was the second time Paris hosted the games, after 1900. The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and saw [[Paris]] be selected ahead of [[Amsterdam]], [[Barcelona]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Prague]] and [[Rome]]. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in [[Lausanne]] in 1921.<ref name=votes>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=17 March 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xFvf0ufx |archivedate=17 March 2011}}</ref>

The cost of the Games of the VIII Olympiad was estimated to be 10,000,000[[French franc|₣]]. With total receipts at 5,496,610₣, the Olympics resulted in a hefty loss despite crowds that reached 60,000 people at a time.<ref name=Zarnowski>{{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C.

==Highlights==
[[File:Stade de Colombes 1924.jpg|thumb]]
* The opening ceremony and several sporting events took place in the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Olympic Stadium]] of [[Colombes]] which had a capacity of 45,000 in 1924.
* This VIII Olympiad was the last one organised under the presidency of [[Pierre de Coubertin]].
* The "[[Flying Finn]]s" dominated the long distance running, whilst the British and Americans dominated the shorter events. [[Paavo Nurmi]] won the 1500 m and 5,000 m (which were held with only an hour between them) and the cross country run. [[Ville Ritola]] won the 10,000 m and the 3,000 m [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], while finishing second to Nurmi on the 5,000 m and cross country. [[Albin Stenroos]] won the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], while the [[Finland|Finnish]] team (with Nurmi and Ritola) was victorious in the 3,000 m and cross country team events.
* British runners [[Harold Abrahams]] and [[Eric Liddell]] won the 100 m and 400 m events, respectively. Their stories are depicted in the 1981 movie ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. In addition [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]] won the 800 m competition.
* The [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] distance was fixed at {{convert|42.195|km|mi|abbr=on}}, from the distance run at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London.
* The 1924 Olympics were the first to use the standard 50 m pool with marked lanes.
* Swimmer [[Johnny Weissmuller]] won three gold medals in swimming and one bronze in [[water polo]].
* [[Harold Osborn]] won gold medals and set Olympic records in both the high jump and the decathlon at the 1924 Olympics. His 6' 6" high jump remained the Olympic record for 12 years, while his decathlon score of 7,710.775 points also set a new world record, and resulted in worldwide press coverage calling him the "world’s greatest athlete".
* [[Fencing (sport)|Fencer]] [[Roger Ducret]] of France won five medals, of which three were gold.
* In gymnastics, 24 men scored a perfect 10. Twenty-three of them scored it in the now discontinued event of [[rope climbing]]. Albert Seguin scored a 10 here and also a perfect 10 on side vault.
* Unexpectedly, the national team of Uruguay won the gold medal in football.
* The Olympic motto ''[[Olympic symbols|Citius, Altius, Fortius]]'' (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was used for the first time at the Olympics. It had been used before by the [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques]], a French sporting federation whose founding members included [[Pierre de Coubertin]].<ref>''The Official History of the Olympic Games and the IOC- Athens to Beijing, 1894–2008'': David Miller (2008)</ref>  De Coubertin took the motto from his friend [[Henri Didon]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican priest]] who had coined during a speech before a Paris youth gathering of 1891.<ref name=motto>{{cite web|title=Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_268.pdf|publisher=International Olympics Committee|accessdate=23 August 2012|page=3|format=pdf|year=2002}}; "Sport athlétique", 14 mars 1891: "[...] dans une éloquente allocution il a souhaité que ce drapeau les conduise ‘souvent à la victoire, à la lutte toujours’. Il a dit qu’il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d’être des sports athlétiques: citius, altius, fortius, ‘plus vite, plus haut, plus fort’.", cited in Hoffmane, Simone ''La carrière du père Didon, Dominicain. 1840 - 1900'', Doctoral thesis, Université de Paris IV - Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, ''Les fondements pédagogiques de la devise olympique „citius, altius, fortius"''</ref>
* [[Ireland at the Olympics|Ireland]] was given formal recognition as an independent nation in the Olympic Movement in Paris in 1924 and it was at these games that Ireland made its first appearance in an Olympic Games as an independent nation.
* Originally called ''Semaine des Sports d'Hiver'' ("Week of Winter Sports") and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions held in [[Chamonix]] between 25 January and 5 February 1924 were later designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games. ([[1924 Winter Olympics]])
* These were the first Games to feature an [[Olympic Village]].
* The [[Art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics]] were the first time that the [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Art competitions]] were contested seriously with 193 entries in five categories. A total of 14 medals were awarded, though none were given in the music category.<ref>M. Avé, Comité Olympique Français, pp. 601–612</ref>
