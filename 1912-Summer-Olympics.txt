The '''1912 Summer Olympics''' (Swedish: ''Olympiska sommarspelen 1912''), officially known as the '''Games of the V Olympiad''', were an international [[multi-sport event]] held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], between 5 May and 22 July 1912.  Twenty-eight nations and 2,408 competitors, including 48 women, competed in 102 events in 14 sports. With the exception of tennis (starting on 5 May) and football and shooting (both starting on 29 June), the games were held within a month with an official opening on 6 July. It was the last Olympics to issue solid gold medals and, with [[Japan at the 1912 Summer Olympics|Japan's]] debut, the first time an [[Asia]]n nation participated. Stockholm was the only bid for the games, and was selected in 1909.

The games were the first to have [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics|art competitions]], [[Diving at the 1912 Summer Olympics|women's diving]], [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics|women's swimming]], and the first to feature both the [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's decathlon|decathlon]] and the new [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's pentathlon|pentathlon]], both won by [[Jim Thorpe]]. Electric timing was introduced in [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics|athletics]], while the host country disallowed [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics|boxing]]. [[figure skating at the Olympics|Figure skating]] was rejected by the organizers because they wanted to promote the [[Nordic Games]].
[[United States at the 1912 Summer Olympics|United States]] won the most gold medals (25), while [[Sweden at the 1912 Summer Olympics|Sweden]] won the most medals overall (65).

==Host selection==
Following the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London, the authorities in Sweden immediately sought to ensure that the next games would be held there. There were two Swedish members of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) at the time, [[Viktor Balck]] and [[Clarence von Rosen]].<ref name="off7">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 7.</ref> The pair proposed to the Swedish governing bodies of athletics and gymnastics in order to ensure that they backed any potential bid. Support was given by the national associations on 18 April 1909 for a bid to host the Olympics in Stockholm on the basis that suitable financial arrangements could be made.<ref name="off8">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 8.</ref> [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V]] was petitioned on 6 May 1909 following the publication of preliminary plans for the Stockholm bid that the expected cost of hosting the Games would be 415,000 [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (£23,050 or $115,250). The Government accepted the petition on behalf of the King and supported the bid.<ref name="off8"/>

On 28 May, at the meeting of the IOC in [[Berlin]], the Swedish representatives declared that they had full financial support for hosting the next Games in Stockholm. A deal was made with the German IOC representative on the basis that Berlin would host the [[1916 Summer Olympics]]. [[Pierre de Coubertin]] spoke at the meeting about his concerns that Sweden should ensure that the Games take place, as he did not want a repeat of the problems with Italy hosting the 1908 Games. He also expressed a desire that "the Games must be kept more purely athletic; they must be more dignified, more discreet; more in accordance with classic and artistic requirements; more intimate, and, above all, less expensive."<ref name="off9">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 9.</ref> The Games were duly awarded to Sweden to host in Stockholm as the only nominated host city for the 1912 Summer Olympics.<ref name="off9"/>

==Organization==
[[image:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Baron Pierre de Coubertin wanted the 1912 Games to be "more dignified" than those of 1908.]]
The news that Stockholm was to host the 1912 Olympics was received with enthusiasm by the Swedish public. The organizing committee took de Coubertin's words to heart, and aimed to achieve an Olympic Games which removed those elements which detracted from earlier Games.<ref name="off10">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 10.</ref> The committee was elected in the autumn of 1909, with Balck voted as the President of the committee, and [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf]] selected as Honorary President. The committee's first meeting took place on 7 October, and on 11 October they delegated the arrangements for the individual branches of sports to the relevant governing bodies in Sweden.<ref name="off11">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 11.</ref> There were four exceptions to this, with the game shooting, [[modern pentathlon]] and mountain ascents retained by the Olympic committee, and the horse riding competitions being organized by [[Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland]], who was the inspector of the Swedish cavalry.<ref name="off12">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 12.</ref> Altogether there were 187 members of these committees.<ref name="off13">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 13.</ref>

The official invitation to compete in the Games was issued on 18 November 1910 to 27 countries, either directly or through their representative on the IOC. A further 15 countries were to have been invited, but as they had no IOC representatives, the Swedish authorities were unsure how to proceed.<ref name="off23">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 23.</ref> Once the organizing committee for the Games received confirmation of the athletic associations in each of the 15 countries, they too were sent invitations.<ref name="off25">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 25.</ref> Some 61,800 entry forms were printed for the use of the various nations.<ref name="off26">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 26.</ref>

Free transport was arranged for the invited nations' equipment, and a discount of 50 percent was arranged for competitors and delegates on the state run railway.<ref name="off26"/> A daily newspaper which only covered the Olympics was arranged to be published during the Games, in both English and Swedish.<ref name="off27">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 27.</ref> Further arrangements were made for the general arrival of visitors in order to entertain them whilst they were not at the Games; a [[pleasure garden]] was opened north of the Olympic Stadium, and a series of indoor tennis courts were converted into a restaurant.<ref name="off27"/>

==Venues==
{{Main|Venues of the 1912 Summer Olympics}}
[[image:Olympiastadion Stockholm front.jpg|thumb|right|The front gate of the Stockholm Olympic Stadium, which was built for the 1912 Games.]]
In the initial bid document it was identified that a new stadium would be needed, initially envisaged as being located in the [[Östermalm Athletic Grounds]]. In order to save funds, it was expected that only one of the stadium's stands would be permanent, with the other three made of wood and dismantled following the Games. The cost of that stadium was estimated at 235,000 Kronor.<ref name=off8 /> Arrangements were made with the individual national committees to provide the use of [[Östermalm Athletic Grounds]] and [[Traneberg]].<ref name="off41">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 41.</ref>

It was decided to host the cycling road race around [[Mälaren]], the third largest lake in Sweden.<ref name="off63">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 63.</ref> While it was decided that the water events, including the swimming and the rowing, could be held at [[Djurgårdsbrunnsviken]], a stadium would need to be erected. [[Kaknäs]] was already used as a shooting range, but alterations were needed to accommodate shooting events. Although it was not used as the Olympic stadium as originally intended, Östermalm hosted the lawn tennis and fencing competitions after a tennis pavilion was moved there from another location.<ref name="off167">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 167.</ref>

Five other locations were considered in addition to the Östermalm Athletic Grounds to locate the Olympic Stadium. It was decided to build the [[Stockholm Olympic Stadium]] on the site of the former Stockholm Athletic Grounds in order to retain the other locations for other uses during the Games. By placing it to the north of the city, the Olympic Stadium was within the immediate vicinity of other pre-existing sporting venues. Initial funding was given to the sum of 400,000 Kr for a timber stadium but [[Torben Grut]],<ref name="off168">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 168.</ref> the architect, also drew up alternative plans for a stone stadium. Following discussions with the Swedish Central Association for the Application of Athletics, it was decided that the stone version should be built, and further funds were made available through a national lottery once guarantees were made that no further funding was to be asked for in order to build the stadium.<ref name="off169">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 169.</ref> However it was found that the original estimate for the stone stadium would still be too expensive, and the plans were once more modified in order to simplify the design and reduce costs. An agreement was entered into with a contractor on 2 November 1910 that it would be transferred complete by 25 May 1912.<ref name="off171">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 171.</ref>

==Opening ceremony==
[[image:1912 Opening ceremony - Sweden.JPG|thumb|right|The Swedish team parading in the stadium during the opening ceremony]]
The Games of the V Olympiad were opened on 6 July 1912. The Swedish Royal Family left [[Stockholm Palace]] at 10:40am, and were received at the Olympic Stadium by members of the IOC.<ref name="off307">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 307.</ref> Three thousand competing athletes had already assembled in the nearby Östermalm Athletic Grounds, and began to enter the stadium in alphabetical order by nation according to the Swedish spelling. The Swedish team entered last,<ref name="off308"/> but unlike the later tradition,<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympic Opening Ceremonies|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/slideshow/2012-06-28/olympic-opening-ceremonies.html|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=28 June 2012}}</ref> the Greek team did not enter first.<ref name="off308">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 308.</ref>

A [[hymn]] was sung, a traditional Swedish chant was conducted and prayers were read first in Swedish and then in English.<ref name="off308"/> [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf]] addressed the King on behalf of the Swedish Olympic Association.<ref name="off309">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 309.</ref> King Gustav V then declared the Games officially open; afterwards a trumpet fanfare was played and the Crown Prince called for cheers for the King.<ref name="off310">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 310.</ref> The athletes in their national groups marching out of the stadium in order ended the ceremony.<ref name="off311">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 311.</ref>

{{bq|text=It is with legitimate joy and pride that we Swedes see athletes from every part of the world gathered here with us. It is a great honour for Sweden that Stockholm has been chosen as the scene of the Fifth Olympiad, and I bid all of you, athletes and friends of athletics, a most hearty welcome to this friendly contest of the nations. May the grand thought that found expression in the Olympic Games in classic times be so held in honour by our age too, that these competitions may become a powerful means to promote the physical health and development of every people. With these words, I herewith declare the Olympic Games of Stockholm opened.|sign=King Gustav V |source=<ref name="off310"/>}}

==Events==
The Swedish delegation at the IOC meeting in Berlin on 28 May 1909 had proposed a simple Olympic schedule containing only "pure" athletics, swimming, gymnastics and wrestling. However other countries requested that the schedule be more comprehensive,<ref name="off20">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 20.</ref> and with that in mind they put forward a further programme at the IOC meeting in 1911 which was met with approval. The sports which were added were the [[tug of war]], cycling, fencing, football, horse riding, lawn tennis, rowing, shooting, skating and yacht racing.<ref name="off22">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 22.</ref><ref name="off53">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 53.</ref> The question of adding skating to the programme was discussed once more on 7 February 1910, with the decision being made to drop it from the schedule. It was felt to be unsuitable because it was a winter sport, and it was to be part of the [[Nordic Games]] the following year.<ref name="off53"/> Boxing was removed from the programme as it was unappealing to the Swedes.<ref>{{cite news|title=A journey of 116 years|url=http://www.sportstaronnet.com/stories/20120712505602700.htm|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Sportstar Weekly}}</ref> [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were considered at a further meeting on 14 February 1910,<ref name="off53"/> and were subsequently added to the programme,<ref name=off806 /> but now art competitions are no longer regarded as official Olympic events by the [[International Olympic Committee]].
As a result, now the 1912 Summer Olympics programme considered composed of 14 sports encompassing 18 disciplines and 102 events. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

The athletic events saw the introduction of an automatic timing system developed by R. Carlstedt. It involved attaching [[electromagnet]]s to [[Stopwatch|chronometers]] in a system which attached a control lamp to the starting gun for each race. This resulted in the firing of the gun starting a timer which was then stopped by one of the judges at the finishing line.<ref name="off348">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 348.</ref> The final of the [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|men's 100 metres]] was expected to be a mostly American affair, and it ended up with six athletes, only one of whom was not from the United States. It suffered from seven false starts before the athletes finally got away, with [[Ralph Craig]] winning the gold medal by {{convert|60|cm|in}} in front of second place [[Alvah Meyer]].<ref name="off353">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 353.</ref><ref name="off354">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 354.</ref>

[[Shizo Kanakuri|Kanakuri Shizō]], a [[Japan]]ese marathon runner, went missing during the race. He stopped at a party taking place in a villa on the marathon route in order to quench his thirst, then caught a train to Stockholm and left the country the next day. He returned to Japan without notifying race officials. 50 years later, after being invited back by the Swedish authorities, he completed the race with an (unofficial) time of 54 years, 8 months, 6 days, 8 hours, 32 minutes and 20.3 seconds.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scorecard|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079689/3/index.htm|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|date=3 April 1967}}</ref> [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Francisco Lázaro]] died from [[heat exhaustion]] while running the marathon, the only athlete to die during the running of an Olympic marathon.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marathon History|url=http://aimsworldrunning.org/marathon_history.htm|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=Association of International Marathons and Distance Races}}</ref>

American [[Jim Thorpe]] won the [[pentathlon]] and the newly created [[decathlon]]. He was disqualified and stripped of his medals for violation of the rules of [[amateurism]], as he had played two seasons' worth of semi-professional baseball before coming to the Games.<ref name=allrounder>{{cite news|title=Jim Thorpe an all-rounder|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=11670|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The Island|date=20 November 2010}}</ref> In 1982, those medals were restored by the IOC, with replicas of the medals given to his relatives as he had died thirty years earlier.<ref name=allrounder/><ref name=rollercoaster>{{cite news|last=Botelho|first=Greg|title=Roller-coaster life of Indian icon, sports' first star|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/07/09/jim.thorpe/|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=14 July 2004}}</ref>

New [[Olympic record]]s were set in the majority of track and field events, with only the men's [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metres|200 metres]], [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 10 kilometres walk|10 km walk]], [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's high jump|standing high jump]], [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's standing long jump|standing broad jump]], [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's triple jump|hop, step and jump]], and the hurdle competitions failing to have new records set. [[Hannes Kolehmainen]] was the most successful in setting records at the games, with new Olympic Records set in the [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 5000 metres|5,000]], [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 metre]] and [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's individual cross country|cross country]] races.<ref name="off850">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 850.</ref>

===Cycling===
{{Main|Cycling at the 1912 Summer Olympics}}
The cycling events at the 1912 Games were limited to a road race around Lake [[Mälaren]], which had already been a successful route for a yearly cycling race.<ref name="off428">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 428.</ref> Although not originally in the schedule, several countries requested that track cycling be added;<ref name="off428"/> however, the organizing committee stuck by their plans not to build a new track cycling stadium as the only one in Stockholm had been destroyed in order for the Olympic Stadium to be built.<ref name="off427">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 427.</ref> In addition, Germany had specifically requested Cycle-Polo and Figure-Cycling to be added to the programme, both of which requests were turned down by the committee.<ref name="off429">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 429.</ref>

It was decided to hold the road race as a time trial, and to outlaw any non-competitive cyclists acting as [[Pacemaker (running)|pacemakers]].<ref name="off429"/> Nineteen nations entered 151 athletes into the competition, which was a greater number than expected by the committee.<ref name="off431">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 431.</ref> The largest group was from Great Britain, who had entered twelve competitors from England, another twelve from Scotland, and a further nine from Ireland.<ref name="off432">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 432.</ref> The race began on 7 July, with the athletes leaving in groups. The first group left at 2am, with the remaining groups leaving at intervals of two minutes.<ref name="off438">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 438.</ref> The distance raced was {{convert|318|km|mi}}, with South African [[Rudolph Lewis]] winning the gold medal in the individual race. [[Frederick Grubb]] of Great Britain won the silver medal, and [[Carl Schutte]] of the United States won the bronze.<ref name="off443">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 443.</ref> However, the average positions of the Swedish team were better than their competitors', and so the Swedish team won the gold medal for the team competition. The silver and bronze medals followed the individual victories, going to Great Britain and the United States respectively – giving Grubb and Schutte a second medal each of the same varieties.<ref name="off450">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 450.</ref>

===Diving===
{{Main|Diving at the 1912 Summer Olympics}}
All of the medals in the men's competitions were split between the diving teams of the Swedish and German teams. The men's high dive was a Swedish white out, with Swedish divers taking all three medal positions. [[Erik Adlerz]] took the gold medal,<ref name="off730">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 730.</ref> and proceeded to take the gold medal for Sweden in the 10 metre platform too. [[Albert Zürner]] took the silver for Germany, and [[Gustaf Blomgren]] won the bronze medal for Sweden.<ref name="off738">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 738.</ref> Another white out occurred in the 3 metre springboard with all three medals going to the German team, with [[Paul Günther]] taking gold, [[Hans Luber]] in the silver medal position and [[Kurt Behrens]] in bronze.<ref name="off738"/> A 10-metre platform event also took place for women, with Sweden taking two more medals, [[Greta Johansson]] in gold and [[Lisa Regnell]] in silver. Great Britain's [[Isabelle White]] won the bronze medal. The remaining finalists were all from Sweden.<ref name="off739">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 739.</ref>

===Equestrian===
{{Main|Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics}}
[[image:1912 Axel Nordlander.JPG|thumb|left|Axel Nordlander, who won two gold medals for Sweden in the dressage]]
Equestrian made its first appearance at a modern Olympics in the 1912 Games.<ref name="off564"/> Although competitions involving horse riding had been included in the [[1900 Summer Olympics|programme of 1900]], this was the first appearance of modern Olympic staples such as [[dressage]], [[eventing]] and [[show jumping]]. It was expected that the competitors would be military personnel as they would have had the cavalry experience to compete.<ref name="off564">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 564.</ref> The competition was split between the military competitions,<ref name="off583">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 583.</ref> prize riding and prize jumping.<ref name="off593">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 593.</ref><ref name="off595">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 595.</ref>

In the military competition, seven countries put forward competitors for the individual and team eventing. Each nation put forward four athletes with the exception of [[Denmark]], which only put forward three. Some of the countries also nominated reserves in addition to their main athletes. The total length of the course was {{convert|55|km|mi}} with the start and finish both in the grounds of the Field Riding Club. The heat was such on the day of the event that competitors lost as much as {{convert|4.5|lb|kg}}in weight.<ref name="off583"/> Swede [[Axel Nordlander]] won the individual competition, and led the Swedish eventing team to victory as well, earning himself two gold medals. In second place in the individual competition was German [[Friedrich von Rochow]], who also earned a second silver medal as the team from Germany placed second overall. Only the bronze medals were split up between nationalities, with the American team taking the bronze for the team event while Frenchman [[Jean Cariou]] won the individual medal.<ref name="off592">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 592.</ref>

Two additional countries entered for the dressage, although only Sweden entered the maximum number of competitors.<ref name="off593"/> The event resulted in Sweden taking all three medals, with the gold going to [[Carl Bonde]], the silver to [[Gustaf Adolf Boltenstern]] and the bronze to [[Hans von Blixen-Finecke]].<ref name="off856">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 856.</ref> The individual show jumping competition was the only individual equestrian event at the 1912 Olympics in which Sweden won no medals, with the gold medal instead going to Cariou of the French to add to his bronze medal from the dressage, [[Rabod von Kröcher]] taking the silver for Germany, and [[Emmanuel de Blommaert]] winning the bronze for [[Belgium]].<ref name="off856"/> The team event saw Sweden take another gold medal, with the French team second and the German team, featuring [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1893–1917)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]], in the bronze medal position.<ref name="off602">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 602.</ref>

===Fencing===
{{Main|Fencing at the 1912 Summer Olympics}}
The foil competition became a full Olympic event, having appeared at the 1908 Games as a demonstration sport.<ref name="off466">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 466.</ref> [[Nedo Nadi]] and [[Pietro Speciale]] of Italy took the gold and silver medals respectively, and [[Richard Verderber]] of [[Austria]] placed third.<ref name="off465">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 465.</ref> There were individual and team events in both épée and sabre.

Thirteen countries signalled their intention to enter [[Association football|football]] teams for the 1912 Olympics. A standard cup tie system was implemented, with the final deciding the gold and silver medallists and a third/fourth position playoff deciding the bronze medal winner.

In the evening of 7 July, demonstrations took place in the Olympic Stadium of sports from the Swedish island of [[Gotland]].

At the same time, at the other end of the stadium, a type of [[Iceland]]ic wrestling called [[Glima]] was demonstrated.<ref name="off817">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 817.</ref> Once those displays had concluded, further demonstrations were made of the Swedish sport [[varpa]], similar to [[quoits]], and ''stångstörtning'', a version of the [[caber toss]].<ref name="off818">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 818.</ref>

Baseball was also demonstrated at the Games, having only appeared recently in Sweden two years before. The Vesterås Baseball Club were invited to make a demonstration on one evening during the Games. The American delegation at the Games had brought along baseball uniforms, but the American Olympic Committee refused to risk injury to its athletes by having the baseball demonstration take place whilst there were any events still to take place involving those athletes. Therefore, the game was played on 17 July at the Östermalm Athletic Grounds, as the Olympic Stadium was being used for the equestrian competition.<ref name="off823">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 823.</ref> The United States lent some players to the Swedish team to make up numbers, but still ended up defeating the hosts 13–3.<ref name="off824">[[#official|Official Report (1913)]]: p. 824.</ref>
