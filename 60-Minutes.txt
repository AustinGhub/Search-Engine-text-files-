'''''60 Minutes''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[newsmagazine]] [[television program]] broadcast on the [[CBS]] television network. Debuting in 1968, the program was created by [[Don Hewitt]], who chose to set it apart from other news programs by using a unique style of reporter-centered investigation. In 2002, ''60 Minutes'' was ranked #6 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]]<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml||author=Bootie Cosgrove-Mather|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=April 26, 2002|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> and in 2013, it was ranked #24 on TV Guide's 60 Best Series of All Time.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/ TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time]</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' has called it "one of the most esteemed news magazines on American television".<ref name=nytloganapology>{{cite news|title=CBS Correspondent Apologizes for Report on Benghazi Attack|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/business/media/cbs-correspondent-apologizes-for-report-on-benghazi-attack.html|author=Bill Carter|author2=Michael S.

==Broadcast history==

===Early years===
[[Image:60 Minutes.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Since 1968, the opening of ''60 Minutes'' features a stopwatch.<ref>{{cite news|title=Timely Donation From '60 Minutes'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/09/22/national/main18102.shtml|work=CBS News|date=September 22, 1998}}</ref> The Aristo (Heuer) design first appeared in 1978. On October 29, 2006, the background changed to red, the title text color changed to white, and the stopwatch was shifted to the upright position. This version was used from 1992 to 2006 (the [[Eurostile]] font text was changed in 1998).]]
The program employed a magazine format, similar to that of the Canadian program ''[[W5 (TV series)|W5]]'', which premiered two years earlier. It pioneered many of the most important [[investigative journalism]] procedures and techniques, including re-editing interviews, hidden cameras, and "[[gotcha journalism]]" visits to the home or office of an investigative subject.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|page=36|author=[[David Frum]]|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7}}</ref> Similar programs sprang up in Australia and Canada during the 1970s, as well as on local television news.<ref name="'70s"/>

Initially, ''60 Minutes'' aired as a bi-weekly show hosted by [[Harry Reasoner]] and [[Mike Wallace]], debuting on September 24, 1968, and alternating weeks with other [[CBS News]] productions on Tuesday evenings at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The first edition, described by Reasoner in the opening as a "kind of a magazine for television," featured the following segments:
# A look inside the headquarters suites of presidential candidates [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] during their respective parties' national conventions that summer;
# Commentary by European writers [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], [[Peter von Zahn]], and [[Luigi Barzini, Jr.]] on the American electoral system;
# A commentary by political columnist [[Art Buchwald]];
# An interview with then-[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]] about police brutality;
# "A Digression," a brief, scripted piece in which two silhouetted men (one of them [[Andy Rooney]]) discuss the presidential campaign;
# An abbreviated version of an [[Academy Award]]-winning short film by [[Saul Bass]], ''[[Why Man Creates]];'' and
# A meditation by Wallace and Reasoner on the relation between perception and reality. Wallace said that the show aimed to "reflect reality".

The first "magazine-cover" [[chroma key]] was a photo of two helmeted policemen (for the Clark interview segment). Wallace and Reasoner sat in chairs on opposite sides of the set, which had a cream-colored backdrop; the more famous black backdrop (which is still used {{as of|2015|lc=y}}) did not appear until the following year. The logo was in [[Helvetica]] type with the word "Minutes" spelled in all lower-case letters; the logo most associated with the show (rendered in [[Eurostile]] type with "Minutes" spelled in uppercase) did not appear until about 1974. Further, to extend the magazine motif, the producers added a "Vol. xx, No. xx" to the title display on the chroma key; modeled after the volume and issue number identifications featured in print magazines, this was used until about 1971. The trademark stopwatch, however, did not appear on the inaugural broadcast; it would not debut until several episodes later. [[Alpo (pet food)|Alpo]] dog food was the sole sponsor of the first program.<ref name="60MinutesHD">{{cite web|title=60 Minutes Goes HD With Nominees|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/60-minutes-goes-hd-with-nominees/22031|author=Steve K|work=[[AdWeek|TVNewser]]|publisher=[[Mediabistro.com]]|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

Don Hewitt, who had been a producer of the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' with [[Walter Cronkite]], sought out Wallace as a stylistic contrast to Reasoner.<ref name="Madsen">Madsen, p. 14</ref> According to one historian of the show, the idea of the format was to make the hosts the reporters, to always feature stories that were of national importance but focused upon individuals involved with, or in conflict with, those issues, and to limit the reports' airtime to around 13 minutes.<ref name="Madsen"/> However, the initial season was troubled by lack of network confidence, as the program did not garner ratings much higher than that of other CBS News documentaries. As a rule, during that era, news programming during [[prime time]] lost money; networks mainly scheduled [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs in prime time in order to bolster the prestige of their news departments, and thus boost ratings for the regular evening newscasts, which were seen by far more people than documentaries and the like. ''60 Minutes'' struggled under that stigma during its first three years.

Changes to ''60 Minutes'' came fairly early in the program's history. When Reasoner left CBS to co-anchor [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[ABC World News Tonight|evening newscast]] (he would return to CBS and ''60 Minutes'' in 1978), [[Morley Safer]] joined the team in 1970, and he took over Reasoner's duties of reporting less aggressive stories. However, when Richard Nixon began targeting press access and reporting, even Safer, formerly the CBS News bureau chief in [[Saigon]] and [[London]], began to do "hard" investigative reports, and during the 1970–71 season alone ''60 Minutes'' reported on [[cluster bomb]]s, the [[South Vietnamese Army]], [[draft dodger]]s, [[Nigeria]], the Middle East, and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="Madsen 15">Madsen, p. 15</ref>

===Effects from the Prime Time Access Rule===
[[File:General Schwartz on 60 Minutes.jpg|thumb|Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. [[Norton A. Schwartz]] in an interview with [[Lara Logan]], April 15, 2009.]]
By 1971, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) introduced the [[Prime Time Access Rule]], which freed local network affiliates in the top 50 markets (in practice, the entire network) to take a half-hour of prime time from the networks on Mondays through Saturdays and one full hour on Sundays. Because nearly all affiliates found production costs for the FCC's intended goal of increased public affairs programming very high and the ratings (and by association, advertising revenues) low, making it mostly unprofitable, the FCC created an exception for network-authored news and public affairs shows. After a six-month hiatus in late 1971, CBS found a prime place for ''60 Minutes'' in a portion of that displaced time, 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern; 5:00 to 6:00 [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]] on Sundays, in January 1972.<ref name="Madsen 15"/>

This proved somewhat less than satisfactory, however, because in order to accommodate [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]' telecasts of late afternoon [[National Football League]] (NFL) football games, ''60 Minutes'' went on hiatus during the fall from 1972 to 1975 (and the summer of 1972). This took place because football telecasts were protected contractually from interruptions in the wake of the infamous "[[Heidi Game|Heidi Bowl]]" incident on [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] in November 1968. Despite the irregular scheduling, the program's hard-hitting reports attracted a steadily growing audience, particularly during the waning days of the [[Vietnam War]] and the gripping events of the [[Watergate scandal]]; at that time, few if any other major network news shows did in-depth investigative reporting to the degree carried out by ''60 Minutes.'' Eventually, during the summers of 1973 through 1975, CBS did allow the program back onto the prime time schedule proper, on Fridays in 1973 and Sundays the two years thereafter, as a replacement for programs aired during the regular television season.

It was only when the FCC returned an hour to the networks on Sundays (for children's/family or news programming), which had been taken away from them four years earlier, in a 1975 amendment to the Access Rule that CBS finally found a viable permanent timeslot for ''60 Minutes.'' When a family-oriented drama, ''[[Three for the Road (TV series)|Three for the Road]]'', ended after a 12-week run in the fall, the newsmagazine took its place at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (6:00 Central) on December 7. It has aired at that time since, for 40 years {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, making ''60 Minutes'' not only the longest-running prime time program currently in production, but also the television program (excluding daily programs such as evening newscasts or [[breakfast television|morning news-talk]] shows) broadcasting for the longest length of time at a single time period each week in U.S. television history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

This move, and the addition of then-[[The White House|White House]] correspondent [[Dan Rather]] to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This was no less than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs on network television. By 1976, ''60 Minutes'' became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the U.S. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the [[Nielsen ratings]], unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS; advertising rates went from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.<ref>Madsen, p. 17</ref>

The program sometimes does not start until after 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern, due largely to CBS' live broadcast of NFL games. At the conclusion of an NFL game, ''60 Minutes'' will air in its entirety. However, on the West Coast (and all of the [[Mountain Time Zone]]), because the actual end of the live games is much earlier in the afternoon in comparison to the Eastern and Central time zones, ''60 Minutes'' is always able to start at its normal start time of 7:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], leaving affiliates free to broadcast local news, the ''CBS Evening News'', and other local or [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]] leading up to ''60 Minutes''. The program's success has also led [[CBS Sports]] to schedule events (such as the [[Masters Tournament]] and daytime games of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]]) leading into ''60 Minutes'' and the rest of the network's primetime lineup, thus (again, except on the West Coast) pre-empting the Sunday editions of the ''CBS Evening News'' and affiliates' local newscasts.

With complaints of late starts because of late NFL games, starting in the 2012-13 season, CBS officially changed the start time of ''60 Minutes'' to 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time on Sundays when the network is scheduled to air an NFL [[doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]] (there are nine during the NFL season – eight during the first 16 weeks of the season, and the final week).<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Responds to NFL Doubleheaders by Pushing Sunday Series Back 30 Minutes|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-wife-mentalist-amazing-race-premieres-schedule-nfl-369481|author=Michael O'Connell|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 11, 2012}}</ref>

====Pre-emptions since 1978====
The program has rarely been pre-empted since 1978. Two notable pre-emptions occurred in 1976 and 1977, to make room for the annual telecast of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which had recently returned to CBS after having been shown on [[NBC]] for eight years. However, CBS would, in later years, schedule the film so that it would no longer pre-empt ''60 Minutes''. Another exception is on years when CBS airs the [[Super Bowl]] or since 2003, alternating years where the [[AFC Championship Game]] has the 6:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern start time, which is played into prime-time and followed by a special lead-out program.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

On September 22, 2013, CBS chose to pre-empt ''60 Minutes'' as a result of carrying the [[65th Primetime Emmy Awards]] after an NFL doubleheader.<ref name=2013emmys>{{cite news|title='60 Minutes' to be Preempted on September 22|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/19/60-minutes-to-be-preempted-on-september-22/203838/|author= Sara Bibel|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=[[Zap2It]] ([[Tribune Media]])|date=September 19, 2013|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>

===Radio broadcast and Internet distribution===
''60 Minutes'' is also simulcast on several [[CBS Radio]] stations ( such as KYW in Philadelphia, [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] in [[New York City]], [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] in [[Chicago]], [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]] and [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]] in [[San Francisco]]) when it airs locally on their sister CBS Television Network affiliate; even in the Central and Eastern time zones, the show is aired at the top of the hour at 7 p.m./6 p.m Central (barring local sports play-by-play pre-emptions and breaking news coverage) no matter how long the show is delayed on CBS Television, resulting in radio listeners often hearing the show on those stations ahead of the television broadcast. An audio version of each broadcast without advertising began to be distributed via [[podcast]] and the [[iTunes Store]], starting with the September 23, 2007 broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Making 60 Minutes Available as Free Podcast|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/cbs-making-60-minutes-available-free-podcast/30717|author=Alex Weprin|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=September 20, 2007|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> Video from ''60 Minutes'' (including full episodes) is also made available for streaming several hours after the program's initial broadcast on CBSNews.com and [[CBS Interactive]] property [[CNET TV]].

==Format==
''60 Minutes'' consists of three long-form news stories, without superimposed graphics. There is a [[Television advertisement|commercial break]] between two stories. Each story is introduced from a set with a backdrop resembling pages from a magazine story on the same topic. The program undertakes its own investigations and follows up on investigations instigated by national newspapers and other sources.  Unlike its most famous competitor ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' as well as traditional local and national news programs, the ''60 Minutes'' journalists ''never'' share the screen with (or speak to) other ''60 Minutes'' journalists on camera at ''any'' time.  This creates a strong psychological sense of intimacy between the journalist and the television viewer.

===Reporting tone===
''60 Minutes'' blends the probing journalism of the seminal 1950s CBS series ''[[See It Now]]'' with [[Edward R. Murrow]] (a show for which Hewitt served as the director for its first few years) and the personality profiles of another Murrow program, ''Person to Person''. In Hewitt's own words, ''60 Minutes'' blends "higher Murrow" and "lower Murrow".{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==="Point/Counterpoint" segment===
For most of the 1970s, the program included ''Point/Counterpoint'', in which a [[liberalism|liberal]] and a [[conservatism|conservative]] commentator debated a particular issue. This segment originally featured [[James J. Kilpatrick]] representing the conservative side and [[Nicholas von Hoffman]] for the liberal, with [[Shana Alexander]] taking over for von Hoffman after he departed in 1974. The segment was an innovation that caught the public imagination as a live version of competing editorials. ''Point/Counterpoint'' was also lampooned by the NBC comedy series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which featured [[Jane Curtin]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] as debaters, with Aykroyd typically beginning his remarks with, "Jane, you ignorant slut"; in the 1980 film ''[[Airplane!]]'', in which the ''faux'' Kilpatrick argues in favor of the plane crashing; and in the earlier [[sketch comedy]] film, ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', where the segment was called "Count/Pointercount".

A similar concept was revived briefly in March 2003, this time featuring [[Bob Dole]] and [[Bill Clinton]], former opponents in the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]]. The pair agreed to do ten segments, called "Clinton/Dole" and "Dole/Clinton" in alternating weeks, but did not continue into the 2003–04 fall television season. Reports indicated that the segments were considered too gentlemanly, in the style of the earlier "Point/Counterpoint", and lacked the feistiness of ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title='60 Minutes' may veto Clinton-Dole face-offs|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2003-05-06-media-mix_x.htm|author=Peter Johnson|newspaper=''[[USA Today]]''|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=May 6, 2003}}</ref>

===Andy Rooney segment===
From 1978 to 2011, the program usually ended with a (usually light-hearted and humorous) commentary by [[Andy Rooney]] expounding on topics of wildly varying import, ranging from international politics, to economics, and to personal philosophy on everyday life. One recurring topic was measuring the amount of [[coffee]] in coffee cans.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Pound of Coffee?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/07/60minutes/rooney/main543240.shtml|author=[[Andy Rooney]]|work=CBS News|date=July 6, 2003}}</ref>

Rooney's pieces, particularly one in which he referred to actor [[Mel Gibson]] as a "wacko," on occasion led to complaints from viewers. Rooney published several books documenting his contributions to the program, including ''Years Of Minutes'' and ''A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney''. Rooney retired from ''60 Minutes'', delivering his final commentary on October 2, 2011; it was his 1,097th commentary over his 34-year career on the program. He died one month later, on November 4, 2011. The November 13, 2011, edition of ''60 Minutes'' featured an hour-long tribute to Rooney and his career, and included a rebroadcast of his final commentary segment.

===Opening sequence===
The opening sequence features a ''60 Minutes'' "magazine cover" with the show's trademark, an [[TAG Heuer|Aristo]] [[stopwatch]], intercut with preview clips of the episode's stories. The sequence ends with each of the current correspondents and hosts introducing themselves. The last host who appears (currently [[Scott Pelley]]) then currently says, "Those stories tonight on ''60 Minutes''". When Rooney was a prominent fixture, the final line was "Those stories and Andy Rooney, tonight on ''60 Minutes''". Before that, and whenever Rooney did not appear, the final line was "Those stories and more, tonight on ''60 Minutes''".

''60 Minutes'' was the first, and remains the only, regularly scheduled program in the U.S. to never have used [[theme music]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The only "theme" is the ticking of the stopwatch, which counts off each of the broadcast's titular 60 minutes, starting from zero at the beginning of each show. It is seen during the opening title sequence, before each commercial break, and at the tail-end of the closing credits, and each time it appears it displays (within reasonable accuracy) the elapsed time of the episode to that point.

On October 29, 2006, the opening sequence changed from a black background, which had been used for over a decade, to white. Also, the gray background for the Aristo stopwatch in the "cover" changed to red, the color for the title text changed to white, and the stopwatch itself changed from the diagonal position it had been oriented in for 31 years to an upright position.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Web content===
Videos and transcripts of ''60 Minutes'' editions, as well as clips that were not included in the broadcast are available on the program's website. In September 2010, the program launched a website called "60 Minutes Overtime", in which stories broadcast on-air are discussed in further detail.<ref>{{cite news|title=Introducing "60 Minutes Overtime"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504803_162-20016663-10391709.html|work=CBS News|date=September 26, 2010}}</ref>

===iPad content===
[[CBS Interactive]] released a [[mobile app]] in 2013, "60 Minutes for iPad", which allows users to watch ''60 Minutes'' on [[iPad]] devices and access some of the show's archival footage.

==Ratings and recognition==

===Nielsen ratings===
Based on [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], ''60 Minutes'' is the most successful program in U.S. television history, since it was moved into its present timeslot in 1975. For five of its seasons it has been that year's top program, a feat matched by the [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', and surpassed only by the reality competition series ''[[American Idol]]'', which had been the #1 show for eight consecutive seasons from the 2003–04 television season up to the 2010–11 season. ''60 Minutes'' was a top ten show for 23 seasons in a row (1977–2000), an unsurpassed record.<ref name=CBS>{{cite news|title=60 Minutes: Milestones|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/20/60minutes/main59202.shtml|work=CBS|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=August 20, 1999|accessdate=May 22, 2007|postscript=News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602120101/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/20/60minutes/main59202.shtml|archivedate=June 2, 2007<!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Record of longest-running show===
''60 Minutes'' currently holds the record for the longest continuously running program of any genre scheduled during American network prime time; it has aired at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays since December 7, 1975 (although since 1998, it is officially scheduled for 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays where a CBS affiliate has a late NFL game). The longer-running ''[[Meet the Press]]'' has also aired in prime time, but currently airs during the daytime, as it has for most of its history. The [[Walt Disney anthology television series]], which premiered in 1954, and the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'', which has aired since 1951, have aired longer, but none of them has aired in prime time continually, as ''60 Minutes'' has done.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Controversies==
The show has been praised for landmark journalism and received many awards. However, it has also become embroiled in some controversy, including (in order of appearance):

===Unintended acceleration===
On November 23, 1986, ''60 Minutes'' aired a segment [[greenlight|greenlit]] by Hewitt, concerning the [[Audi 5000]] automobile, a popular [[Germany|German]] luxury car. The story covered a supposed problem of "unintended acceleration" when the brake pedal was pushed, with emotional interviews with six people who sued Audi (unsuccessfully) after they crashed their cars, including one woman whose 6-year-old boy had been killed. In the ''60 Minutes'' segment footage was shown of an Audi 5000 with the accelerator "moving down on its own", accelerating the car.  It later emerged that an expert witness employed by one of the plaintiffs modified the accelerator with a concealed device, causing the "unintended acceleration".<ref>{{cite news|title=Audi Investigated for Unintended Acceleration|url=http://www.automobile.com/audi-investigated-for-unintended-acceleration.html|work=Automobile.com}}</ref> Independent investigators concluded that this "unintended acceleration" was most likely due to driver error, where the driver let their foot slip off the brake and onto the accelerator. Tests by [[Audi]] and independent journalists showed that even with the [[Wide open throttle|throttle wide open]], the car would simply stall if the brakes were actually being used.<ref>{{cite news|title=Audi's Runaway Trouble With the 5000|author=Brock Yates|work=[[Washington Post Magazine]]|date=December 21, 1986}}</ref>

The incident devastated Audi sales in the United States, which did not rebound for 15 years. The initial incidents which prompted the report were found by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] and [[Transport Canada]] to have been attributable to operator error, where car owners had depressed the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal. CBS issued a partial retraction, without acknowledging the test results of involved government agencies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manufacturing the Audi Scare|url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjm_18.htm|author=Peter Huber|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]]|date=December 18, 1989}}</ref> Years later, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', a rival to ''60 Minutes'', was found guilty of similar tactics regarding the fuel tank integrity of [[Dateline NBC#General Motors vs. NBC|General Motors pickup trucks]].<ref>{{cite web|title='Dateline' Disaster: NBC and General Motors feud over a staged car accident|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305709,00.html|author=Bruce Fretts|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Alar===
In February 1989, ''60 Minutes'' aired a report by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] claiming that the use of [[daminozide]] (Alar) on [[apple]]s presented an unacceptably high health risk to consumers. Apple sales dropped and CBS was sued unsuccessfully by apple growers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judge Dismisses Apple Growers' Suit Against CBS|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D61F31F937A2575AC0A965958260|work=The New York Times|date=September 14, 1993|accessdate=July 21, 2007|quote=A Federal judge today dismissed a lawsuit that apple growers in Washington State filed against CBS after "60 Minutes" broadcast a report linking the chemical Alar to cancer. The report, broadcast Feb. 26, 1989, said the use of Alar increased the risk of cancer in humans, particularly children, and cited a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council.}}</ref> Alar was subsequently banned for use on food crops in the U.S. by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

===Werner Erhard===
On March 3, 1991, ''60 Minutes'' broadcast "[[Werner Erhard]]," which dealt with controversies involving Erhard's personal and business life. One year after the ''60 Minutes'' piece aired, Erhard filed a lawsuit against CBS, claiming that the broadcast contained several "false, misleading and defamatory" statements about himself. One month after filing the lawsuit, Erhard filed for dismissal.<ref name="docket">''Werner Erhard vs. Columbia Broadcasting System'', (Filed: March 3, 1992) Case Number: 1992-L-002687. Division: Law Division. District: First Municipal.

===Brown & Williamson===
In 1995, former [[Brown & Williamson]] Vice President for Research and Development [[Jeffrey Wigand]] provided information to ''60 Minutes'' producer [[Lowell Bergman]] that B&W had systematically hidden the health risks of their cigarettes (see [http://jeffreywigand.com/pascagoula.php transcription]). Furthermore, it was alleged that B&W had introduced foreign agents (such as [[Fiberglass#Health problems|fiberglass]] and [[Ammonia#As a stimulant|ammonia]]) with the intent of enhancing the effect of [[nicotine]]. Bergman began to produce a piece based upon the information, but ran into opposition from Don Hewitt who, along with CBS lawyers, feared a billion dollar lawsuit from Brown and Williamson for [[tortious interference]] for encouraging Wigand to violate his [[non-disclosure agreement]]. A number of people at CBS would benefit from a sale of CBS to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], including the head of CBS lawyers and CBS News. Also, because of the interview, the son of CBS President [[Laurence Tisch]] (who also controlled [[Lorillard Tobacco Company|Lorillard Tobacco]]) was among the people from the [[Big Tobacco|big tobacco companies]] at risk of being caught having committed perjury. Due to Hewitt's hesitation, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' instead broke Wigand's story. The ''60 Minutes'' piece was eventually aired with substantially altered content and minus some of the most damning evidence against B&W. The [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] of the incident was published in an article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' by [[Marie Brenner]], entitled "The Man Who Knew Too Much".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much|url=http://www.mariebrenner.com/articles/insider/man1.html|author=[[Marie Brenner]]|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=MarieBrenner.com|date=May 1996}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' wrote that "the traditions of Edward R. Murrow and "60 Minutes" itself were diluted in the process,"<ref>{{cite news|title=Self-Censorship at CBS|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/opinion/self-censorship-at-cbs.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|work=The New York Times|date=November 12, 1995}}</ref> though the newspaper revised the quote slightly, suggesting that ''60 Minutes'' and CBS had "betrayed the legacy of Edward R. Murrow". The incident was turned into a seven-times [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated feature film entitled ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'', directed by [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] and starring [[Russell Crowe]] as Wigand, [[Al Pacino]] as Bergman, and [[Christopher Plummer]] as Mike Wallace. Wallace denounced the portrayal of him as inaccurate to his stance on the issue.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===U.S. Customs Service===
''60 Minutes'' alleged in 1997 that agents of the [[U.S. Customs Service]] ignored drug trafficking across the [[Mexico–United States border]] at [[San Diego]].<ref>{{cite news|title=I'd Rather Be Blogging: CBS stonewalls as 'guys in pajamas' uncover a fraud.|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=110005611|author=[[John Fund]]|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 13, 2004}}</ref> The only evidence was a memorandum apparently written by Rudy Camacho, who was the head of the San Diego branch office. Based on this memo, CBS alleged that Camacho had allowed trucks belonging to a particular firm to cross the border unimpeded. Mike Horner, a former Customs Service employee, had passed the memos on to ''60 Minutes'', and even provided a copy with an official stamp. Camacho was not consulted about the piece, and his career was devastated in the immediate term as his own department placed suspicion on him. In the end, it turned out that Horner had forged the documents as an act of revenge for his treatment within the Customs Service. Camacho sued CBS and settled for an undisclosed amount of money in damages. Hewitt was forced to issue an on-air retraction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Another 60 Minutes' Apology on a Drug Smuggling Story|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/40513764.html?did=40513764&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&dids=40513764:40513764:&date=Apr+13,+1999&author=Lisa+de+Moraes&desc=Another+`60+Minutes'+Apology+on+a+Drug+Smuggling+Story|author=Lisa de Moraes|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 13, 1999}}</ref>

===Kennewick Man===
A legal battle between archaeologists and the [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]] tribe over the remains of a skeleton, nicknamed [[Kennewick Man]], was reported by ''60 Minutes'' on October 25, 1998, to which the Umatilla tribe reacted negatively. The tribe considered the segment heavily biased in favor of the scientists, cutting out important arguments, such as explanations of [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennewick Man issue damages relationships|url=http://www.umatilla.nsn.us/kman3.html|author=Antone Minthorn|work=Board of Trustees Chairman [[Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation]]|date=November 5, 1998}}</ref> The report focused heavily on the racial politics of the controversy and also added inflammatory arguments, such as questioning the legitimacy of [[Native Americans|Native American]] sovereignty<ref>{{cite web|title=Bones of Contention|url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-01/no-02/kennewick/kennewick-2.shtml|author=Ann Fabien|work=Common-Place.org|accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> – much of the racial focus of the segment was later reported to have been either unfounded and/or misinterpreted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who Were The First Americans?|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1169905,00.html|author=[[Michael D.

===Timothy McVeigh===
On March 12, 2000, ''60 Minutes'' aired an interview with [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber]] [[Timothy McVeigh]]. At the time, McVeigh had already been convicted and sentenced to death for the April 1995 bombing of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] and subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government.<ref>{{cite news|title=McVeigh Vents On '60 Minutes'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/13/national/main171231.shtml|work=CBS News|date=March 13, 2000}}</ref> Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit Media Policy was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with [[death row]] inmates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Journalism, Edward R.

===Viacom/CBS cross-promotion===
In recent years, the program has been accused of promoting books, films, and interviews with celebrities who are published or promoted by sister businesses of media conglomerate Viacom (which owned CBS from 2000 to 2005, and is now a separate company owned by [[National Amusements]], which is also the parent of [[CBS Corporation]]) and publisher [[Simon & Schuster]] (which remains a part of CBS Corporation after the 2005 CBS/Viacom split), without disclosing the journalistic conflict-of-interest to viewers.<ref>{{cite news|title=All in the Family: Who says 60 Minutes doesn't pay for interviews?|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/preston_regan200404020931.asp|author=Bryan Preston|author2=Chris Regan|work=[[National Review]]|date=April 2, 2004}}</ref>

===Killian documents controversy===
{{main|Killian documents controversy}}
The Killian documents controversy (also referred to as Memogate or Rathergate{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}) involved six documents critical of President [[George W. Bush]]'s service in the [[Texas Air National Guard]] in 1972–73. Four of these documents were presented as authentic in a ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]], but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents. Subsequently, several typewriter and typography experts concluded the documents are forgeries, as have some media sources. No forensic document examiners or typography experts authenticated the documents, which may not be possible without original documents. The provider of the documents, Lt. Col. Bill Burkett, claimed to have burned the originals after faxing copies to CBS.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==="The Internet Is Infected" episode and the false hacker photo===
A segment aired on the March 29, 2009, edition of ''60 Minutes'', "The Internet Is Infected", featured an interview with Don Jackson, a data protection professional for [[Dell SecureWorks|SecureWorks]]. Jackson himself declares in the program that: "A part of my job is to know the enemy". However, during the interview, Jackson showed a photo of Finnish upper-level comprehensive school pupils and misidentified them as Russian hackers.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS's 60 Minutes airs photo of Finnish children as "Russian hackers" |url=http://finland.fi/stt/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=21336&group=General |work=NewsRoom Finland |publisher=Virtual Finland, [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland]] |date=April 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150214223232/http://finland.fi/stt/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=21336&group=General |archivedate=February 14, 2015 }}</ref> In the photo, one of the children is wearing a jacket with the Coat of Arms of Finland on it. Another one is wearing a cap which clearly has the logo of [[Karjala]], a Finnish brand of beer, on it. The principal of the school in [[Taivalkoski]] confirmed that the photo was taken at the school about five years before the program was broadcast.<ref name=kaleva>{{cite news|title=Amerikkalaisohjelma leimasi taivalkoskelaisnuoret venäläisiksi nettirikollisiksi|url=http://www.kaleva.fi/plus/index.cfm?j=789464|work=[[Kaleva (newspaper)|Kaleva]]|date=March 31, 2009}}. {{fi icon}}</ref>

The photo's exact origins are unknown, but it is widely known in Finland, having been originally posted to a Finnish social networking site, IRC-Galleria, in the early 2000s.

===Benghazi report===
Subsequent to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]], ''60 Minutes'' aired report by correspondent [[Lara Logan]] on October 27, 2013, in which British military contractor, Dylan Davies, identified by CBS under the pseudonym "Morgan Jones," described racing to the Benghazi compound several hours after the main assault was over, scaling a 12-foot wall and knocking out a lone fighter with the butt of a rifle. He also claimed to have visited a Benghazi hospital earlier that night where he saw Ambassador Christopher Stevens' body.

In the days following the report, Davies' personal actions were challenged.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/60-minutes-broadcast-helps-propel-new-round-of-back-and-forth-on-benghazi/2013/10/31/fbfcad66-4258-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html|title=‘60 Minutes’ broadcast helps propel new round of back-and-forth on Benghazi|work=Washington Post|date=31 October 2013|first=Karen|last=DeYoung}}</ref> The FBI, which had interviewed Davies several times and considered him a credible source,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/14/why-dylan-davies-disappeared.html|title=Why Dylan Davies Disappeared|work=The Daily Beast|date=14 November 2013|first=Eli|last=Lake}}</ref> said the account Davies had given them was different than what he told ''60 Minutes''. Davies stood by his story,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/business/media/cbs-news-defends-its-60-minutes-benghazi-report.html?_r=0|title=CBS News Defends Its ‘60 Minutes’ Benghazi Report|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=5 November 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref> but the inconsistency ultimately prompted ''60 Minutes'' to conclude it was a mistake to include Davies in their report and a correction was issued.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/60-minutes-airs-apology-on-benghazi.html?_r=0|title=‘60 Minutes’ Airs Apology on Benghazi|first1=Brian|last1=Stelter|first2=Bill|last2=Carter|date=10 November 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Following the correction, a journalistic review was conducted by Al Ortiz, CBS News' executive director of standards and practices. He determined that red flags about Davies' account were missed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/lara-logan-60-minutes-leave_n_4344883.html|title=CBS News' Lara Logan Taking Leave Of Absence Over Discredited '60 Minutes' Benghazi Report|work=The Huffington Post|date=26 November 2013|first=Michael|last=Calderone}}</ref> Davies had said to the program and written in his book that he told an alternative version of his actions to his employer, who he said had demanded that he stay inside his Benghazi villa as the attack unfolded.

Davies' book, ''The Embassy House'', was published two days after the ''60 Minutes'' report, by Threshold Editions, part of the Simon and Schuster unit of CBS.

===Tesla Automaker report===
On March 30, 2014, ''60 Minutes'' presented a story on the [[Tesla Model S]] luxury electric [[automobile]] in a segment, with Scott Pelley conducting an interview with CEO [[Elon Musk]] concerning the car brand as well as his [[SpaceX]] company. Within a day, the automotive [[weblog|blog]] site [[Jalopnik]] reported that the sounds accompanying footage of the car shown during the story were actually sounds from a traditional gasoline engine dubbed over the footage, when in reality the electric car is much quieter.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Says It Made 'Audio Editing Error' With Tesla On 60 Minutes|url=http://jalopnik.com/cbs-says-it-made-audio-editing-error-with-tesla-on-60-1555657624|author=Zac Estrada|work=Jalopnik.com|date=March 31, 2014}}</ref> CBS released a statement explaining that the sound was the result of an audio editing error, and subsequently removed the noise from the online version of the piece. However, several news outlets, as well as Jalopnik itself, have expressed doubt over the authenticity of this explanation, noting the similar scandal involving [[Tesla Motors]] and ''The New York Times'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS' '60 Minutes' admits to faking Tesla car noise|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/04/06/tesla-motor-sound-cbs-apology/7320361/|author=Chris Woodyard|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=April 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='60 Minutes' Admits 'Audio Error' In Tesla Story|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/60-minutes-error-sound-car-cbs-engine-audio_n_5070297.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Huffington Post (AOL)|date=April 1, 2014}}</ref>

==Spin-offs==
The main ''60 Minutes'' show has created a number of spin-offs over the years.

===''30 Minutes''===
{{Main|30 Minutes (CBS TV series)}}
''30 Minutes'' was a newsmagazine aimed at children that was patterned after ''60 Minutes'', airing as the final program in CBS's Saturday morning lineup from 1978 to 1982. It was hosted by [[Christopher Glenn]] (who also served as the voice-over for the interstitial program ''[[In the News]]'' and was an anchor on the CBS Radio Network), along with Betsy Aaron (1978–1980) and Betty Ann Bowser (1980–1982).

===''60 Minutes More''===
''60 Minutes More'' was a spin-off that ran for one season from 1996 to 1997. The episodes featured popular stories from the past that were expanded with updates on the original story. Each episode featured three of these segments.<ref name="more">{{cite news|title=60 Minutes More|url=http://www.film.com/tv/60-minutes-more/21327868|publisher=Film.com|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref>

===''60 Minutes II''===
{{Main|60 Minutes II}}
In 1999, a second edition of ''60 Minutes'' was started in the U.S., called ''60 Minutes II''. This edition was later renamed ''60 Minutes'' by CBS for the fall of 2004 in an effort to sell it as a high-quality program, since some had sarcastically referred to it as ''60 Minutes, Jr.'' CBS News president [[Andrew Heyward]] said, "The [[Roman numeral]] II created some confusion on the part of the viewers and suggested a watered-down version".<ref>{{cite news|title='60 Minutes' times 2|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117905294.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|author=Pamela McClintoc|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2004|accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> However, a widely known controversy which came to be known as "[[Killian documents controversy|Rathergate]]", regarding a report that aired September 8, 2004, caused another name change. The program was retitled ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' both to differentiate itself and to avoid tarnishing the Sunday edition, as the editions were editorially independent from one another. It reverted to its original Roman numeral title on July 8, 2005, when the program moved to Fridays in an 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time slot to finish its run. The show's final broadcast was on September 2, 2005.

===''60 Minutes on CNBC''===
In 2011, [[CNBC]] began airing a ''60 Minutes'' spin-off of its own, called ''60 Minutes on CNBC''. Hosted by Lesley Stahl and Steve Kroft, it airs updated business-related reports seen on the original broadcasts and offers footage that were not included when the segments first aired.

===''60 Minutes Sports''===
CBS News began producing a sports-themed version of ''60 Minutes'' for corporate sister and [[pay television|premium channel]] [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] in January 2013. The program, titled ''[[60 Minutes Sports]]'', includes two original segments along with a classic interview from the show's archives. Personalities from [[CBS Sports]] join the ''60 Minutes'' team in contributing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/tv/story/2012/09/13/60-minutes-plans-sports-version-for-showtime/57776812/1|title=60 Minutes plans sports version for Showtime|author=Gary Levin|publisher=USA Today|date=September 13, 2012|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref>

==25th anniversary edition==
For the ''60 Minutes'' 25th anniversary in 1993, [[Charles Kuralt]] interviewed Don Hewitt, the active correspondents, some former correspondents, and revisited notable stories and celebrities.

==International versions==

===Australia===
{{Main|60 Minutes (Australian TV program)}}
The Australian version of ''60 Minutes'' premiered on February 11, 1979. It still airs each Sunday night at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. on the [[Nine Network]] and affiliates. Although Nine Network has the rights to the format, as of 2007, it does not have rights to stories from the U.S. program. Nevertheless, stories from the flagship ''60 Minutes'' program in the U.S. often air on the Australian program by subleasing them from [[Network Ten]]. In 1980, ''60 Minutes'' won a [[Logie Award]] for their investigation of lethal abuses at the Chelmsford psychiatric hospital in [[Sydney]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Germany===
In the mid-1980s, an edited version (approx. 30 minutes in length) of the U.S. broadcast edition of ''60 Minutes'' was shown for a time on West German television. This version retained the English-language soundtrack of the original, but also featured German subtitles.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|60 Minutes (New Zealand TV program)}}
The New Zealand version of ''60 Minutes'' has aired on national television since 1989, when it was originally launched on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]. In 1992, the rights were acquired by [[TVNZ]], who began broadcasting it in 1993. The network aired the program for nine years before dropping it in 2002 for its own program, entitled ''Sunday'', which is currently the highest-rated current affairs show broadcast on New Zealand television, followed by ''[[20/20 (New Zealand television series)|20/20]]''. ''60 Minutes'' was broadcast by rival network TV3, before switching to the Sky Television owned Prime channel in 2013, when the contract changed hands.

===Portugal===

===Chile===
The news program of [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|National Broadcasting of Chile (TVN)]], the public television network in that country, was named ''60 Minutos'' ("60 Minutes") from 1975 to 1988, but the program had no accusations of any kind and no investigative reporting.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
