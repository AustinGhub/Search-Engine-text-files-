It was the year that is usually considered the final year of the [[Cold War]] that had begun in the late [[1940s]]. During the year, the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapsed]] into fifteen sovereign republics. [[India]] also abandoned its policies of [[socialism]] and [[autarky]] and began extensive [[neoliberal]] changes to its economy in July 1991 which would increase the GDP but also [[economic inequality]] over the next two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18988536|title=India's economy: One more push - The Economist|work=The Economist}}</ref> A [[United Nations|U.N.]]-authorized [[coalition of the Gulf War|coalition force]] from thirty-four nations fought against [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], which had invaded [[Kuwait]] in the previous year, [[1990]]. The conflict would be called the [[Gulf War]] and would mark the beginning of a since-constant American military presence in the Middle East. The clash between [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]] and the other [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics would lead into the beginning of the [[Yugoslav Wars]], which ran through the rest of the decade.

The [[Japanese asset price bubble]] collapsed this year, leading to the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Years]] and a permanently stagnated (though still prosperous) Japanese economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html|title=ASIANOW - TIME Asia - Pokémon: The Ultimate Game Freak - Page 1 - 11/22/99|work=cnn.com}}</ref>
