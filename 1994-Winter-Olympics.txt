{{1994 Winter Olympics}}

The '''1994 Winter Olympics''' (Norwegian: ''Vinter-OL 1994''), officially known as the '''XVII Olympic Winter Games''' (French: Les ''XVIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver''), was a winter [[Winter Olympic Games|multi-sport event]] celebrated from 12 to 27 February 1994 in and around [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]]. Lillehammer failed to win the bid for the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 event]]. Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, after beating [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[United States]]; [[Östersund]], [[Sweden]]; and [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Lillehammer is the northernmost city to ever host the Winter Games. The Games were the first to be held in a different year from the Summer Olympics, the first and only one to be held two years after the previous winter games, and the most recent to be held in a small town. The Games were the second winter event hosted in Norway, after the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in Oslo, and the fourth Olympics in the [[Nordic countries]], after the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, and the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].

While many events took place in Lillehammer, skating took place in [[Hamar]], some [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] matches were placed in [[Gjøvik]], while [[Alpine skiing at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Alpine skiing]] was held in [[Øyer]] and [[Ringebu]]. Sixty-seven countries and 1,737 athletes participated in six [[Olympic sports|sports]] and sixty-one events. Fourteen countries made their debut in the Winter Olympics, of which nine were former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republics. The Games also saw the introduction of stricter qualifying rules, reducing the number of under-performing participants from warm-weather countries. New events were two new distances in [[Short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|short track speed skating]] and [[Freestyle skiing at the 1994 Winter Olympics|aerials]], while [[Speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|speed skating]] was moved indoors. Nearly two million people spectated the games, which were the first to have the [[Olympic truce]] in effect. The games were succeeded by the [[1994 Winter Paralympics]] from 10 to 19 March.

[[Manuela Di Centa]] and [[Lyubov Yegorova (cross-country skier)|Lyubov Yegorova]] dominated women's [[Cross-country skiing at the 1994 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]], taking five and four medals, respectively. A crowd of over 100,000 saw [[Italy at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Italy]] beat [[Norway at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Norway]] by 0.4 seconds on the [[Cross-country skiing at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Men's 4 x 10 kilometre relay|men's 4 x 10 km relay]]. [[Vreni Schneider]] won a complete set of medals in Alpine skiing, while Norway took a medal sweep in the [[Alpine skiing at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Men's combined|men's combined]]. [[Nancy Kerrigan]] had, before the games, been [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan|clubbed by Tonya Harding's associate]], but managed to take silver in [[Figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics – Ladies' singles|ladies' singles]]. [[Johann Olav Koss]] won three speed skating events, while 13-year-old [[Kim Yun-Mi (speed skater)|Kim Yoon-Mi]] became the youngest-ever Olympic gold medalist. [[Sweden at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Sweden]] beat [[Canada at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Canada]] in a dramatic [[penalty shootout]] in the [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics#Gold Medal Game|ice hockey final]]. With 11 gold medals, [[Russia at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Russia]] won the most events, while with 26, Norway collected the most medals overall.

Planning of the Lillehammer bid started in 1981, following [[Falun]], Sweden's failed bid for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]].

[[File:1994 Winter Olympics venue map.svg|thumb|Map of the venues]]

The games were spread out over ten venues in five [[municipalities of Norway|municipalities]] in two [[counties of Norway|counties]], [[Oppland]] and [[Hedmark]]. [[Lillehammer]], with 25,000 inhabitants, and [[Hamar]] and [[Gjøvik]], both with 27,000 inhabitants, are all situated on the lake [[Mjøsa]]. Gjøvik and Hamar are located {{convert|45|and|54|km|sp=us}} south of Lillehammer. Hunderfossen is located {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} north of Lillehammer, but lies within the municipality. Øyer and Ringebu, both with just under 5,000 inhabitants, are located {{convert|18|and|50|km|sp=us}} north of Lillehammer, in the valley [[Gudbrandsdalen]]. Lillehammer had four venues, Hamar had two venues, while Hunderfossen, Gjøvik, Øyer and Ringebu had one venue each.<ref>Hove-Ødegård, Celius and Brun: 23</ref>

In Lillehammer, [[Lysgårdsbakken]] features twin [[ski jumping hill]]s. The large hill has a hill size of 138 and a critical point of 120, while the normal hill has a hill size of 100 and a critical point of 90. The hill has capacity for 35,000 spectators and hosted, in addition to the ski jumping events, the opening and closing ceremonies.<ref>LOOC (III): 18–22</ref> [[Birkebeineren Skistadion]] featured cross-country skiing and biathlon, with the stadium itself having a capacity for 31,000 spectators during cross-country skiing and 13,500 during biathlon.

Downtown Lillehammer and the axis between Lillehammer and Oslo were the most limiting areas, and the [[Norwegian State Railways (1883–1996)|Norwegian State Railways]] ran up to 22 trains per day between Oslo and Lillehammer. Trains were also used northwards towards [[Trondheim]], while other areas were served by bus.

Shuttle buses were established between venues and also connected to [[park and ride]] facilities.<ref>LOOC (II): 38–43</ref>

==Politics and Participating National Olympic Committees==
[[File:Vikingskipet-Hamar.jpg|thumb|[[Vikingskipet]] in [[Hamar]] was the venue for [[speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|speed skating]].]]
A record 67 nations participated in the 1994 Winter Olympic Games. The Games were the first following the implementation of stricter qualifying standards, which prevented low-performing athletes from competing without meeting minimum standards. As a consequence, eleven "warm-weather countries" signed up to participate in the Games, but were ultimately absent as none of their athletes succeeded in qualifying. The number of African athletes fell from nineteen in 1992 to three in 1994. These rules were, however, not applied to bobsled events, enabling the [[Virgin Islands at the 1994 Winter Olympics|United States Virgin Islands]], [[Monaco at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Monaco]], [[Trinidad and Tobago at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Jamaica at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Jamaica]] to compete in that sport.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/07/sports/winter-olympics-the-tourist-athlete-gets-snowed-out-of-these-games.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Tourist Athlete Gets Snowed Out of These Games |work=The New York Times |date=7 February 1994 |first=Christopher |last=Clarey |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uvJJ2bGL |archivedate=11 December 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2010}}</ref> On 25 October 1993, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] urged its members to observe the [[Olympic truce]] from seven days before to seven days after the Olympic games, making the Lillehammer games the first to observe the truce.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/events/olympictruce/index.shtml |title=The United Nations and the Olympic Truce |publisher=UN |accessdate=11 December 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uvI4NCTW |archivedate=11 December 2010}}</ref> IOC appealed for a truce in the ongoing [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], the city that had hosted the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/sports/winter-olympics-lillehammer-has-the-war-in-sarajevo-on-its-mind.html?scp=3&sq=lillehammer&st=nyt |title=Lillehammer Has the War in Sarajevo on Its Mind |work=The New York Times |date=8 February 1994 |agency=[[Reuters]] |archiveurl=
