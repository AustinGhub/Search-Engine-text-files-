The '''1992 Winter Olympics''', officially known as the '''XVI Olympic Winter Games''' (French: Les ''XVIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver''), were a winter [[multi-sport event]] celebrated from 8 to 23 February 1992 in [[Albertville]], France. They were the last Winter Olympics to be held the same year as the Summer Olympics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Winter/Albertville-1992/|title=Albertville 1992|publisher=www.olympic.org|accessdate=12 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100328115821/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Winter/Albertville-1992/| archivedate= 28 March 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> and the first where the [[Winter Paralympics]] were held at the same site. Albertville was selected as host in 1986, beating [[Sofia]], [[Falun]], [[Lillehammer]], [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Berchtesgaden]]. The games were the third Winter Olympics held in France, after [[Chamonix]] in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] and [[Grenoble]] in [[1968 Winter Olympics|1968]], and the fifth Olympics overall in the country.

Only some of the skating and the opening and closing ceremonies took place in Albertville, while the rest of the [[Events at the 1992 Winter Olympics|events]] took place in the villages of [[Courchevel]], [[La Plagne]], [[Les Arcs]], [[Les Menuires]], [[Les Saisies]], [[Méribel]], [[Pralognan-la-Vanoise]], [[Tignes]] and [[Val d'Isère]]. Sixty-four nations with 1,801 athletes participated in the games, including the [[Unified Team at the 1992 Winter Olympics|Unified Team]] which represented non-Baltic former Soviet republics. [[Germany at the 1992 Winter Olympics|Germany]] participated as a unified team, while five newly independent European countries debuted, as did six "warm-weather" countries. [[Short track speed skating]], [[Freestyle skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics|moguls]] and [[Biathlon at the 1992 Winter Olympics|women's biathlon]] made their debut as an Olympic sport. The games were the last Winter Games until [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014]] to have [[demonstration sport]]s, consisting of [[Curling at the 1992 Winter Olympics|curling]], [[Freestyle skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics|aerials]], [[Ski ballet at the 1992 Winter Olympics|ski ballet]] and [[Speed skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics|speed skiing]]. It was the last Olympics to have an outdoor [[speed skating rink]]. The games were succeeded by the [[1992 Winter Paralympics]] from 25 March to 1 April.

[[Norway at the 1992 Winter Olympics|Norwegians]] won every male [[Cross-country skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]] race, with [[Bjørn Dæhlie]] and [[Vegard Ulvang]] both collecting three gold. [[Ski jumping at the 1992 Winter Olympics|Ski jumper]] [[Toni Nieminen]], 16, became the youngest male gold medalist of a Winter Olympic event. [[Petra Kronberger]] won both the [[Alpine skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics – Women's combined|combined event]] and the [[Alpine skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics – Women's slalom|slalom]], while [[Bonnie Blair]] won both the [[Speed skating at the 1992 Winter Olympics – Women's 500 metres|500&nbsp;m]] and [[Speed skating at the 1992 Winter Olympics – Women's 1000 metres|1000&nbsp;m]] speed skating events and [[Gunda Niemann]] took both of the longest races. [[Kim Kihoon]] earned gold medals in both men's [[Short track Speed skating at the 1992 Winter Olympics|short track]] events. [[Annelise Coberger]] of [[New Zealand at the 1992 Winter Olympics|New Zealand]] won the southern hemisphere's first Winter Olympic medal—a silver in the women's slalom. [[Nicolas Bochatay]] was killed during a training session. [[Germany at the 1992 Winter Olympics|Germany]] won the most medals and the most gold.
