{{1996 Summer Olympics}}

The '''1996 Summer Olympics''' ({{lang-fr|Jeux olympiques d'été de 1996}}), known officially as the '''Games of the XXVI Olympiad''' and unofficially as the '''Centennial Olympic Games''', was a major international [[multi-sport event]] that took place in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], United States, from July 19 to August 4, 1996. A record 197 nations, all current [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] member nations, took part in the Games, comprising 10,318 athletes. The International Olympic Committee voted in 1986 to separate the Summer and Winter Games, which had been held in the same year since 1924, and place them in alternating even-numbered years, beginning in 1994. The 1996 Summer Games were the first to be staged in a different year from the Winter Games. Atlanta became the fifth American city to host the [[Olympic Games]] and the third to hold a [[Summer Olympic Games]]. It will remain the last time the United States has hosted the Summer Olympics until at least 2024. This marks the first and only [[Olympic Games]] to be held in the [[Southern United States]].

==Organization==
===Bid===
{{Main|Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics}}
Atlanta was selected on September 18, 1990, in [[Tokyo, Japan]], over Athens, Belgrade, Manchester, Melbourne, and Toronto at the [[IOC Session|96th IOC Session]]. Atlanta's bid to host the Summer Games that began in 1987 was considered a long-shot, since the U.S. had hosted the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics just 12 years earlier]] in Los Angeles. Atlanta's main rivals were Toronto, whose front running bid that began in 1986 seemed almost sure to succeed after Canada had held a successful [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, and Melbourne, Australia, who hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] and prior to [[Sydney, Australia]]'s successful [[2000 Summer Olympics]] bid, they felt that the Olympic Games should return to Australia. This would be Toronto's fourth failed attempt since 1960 (tried in 1960, 1964, and 1976).<ref>http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/24/toronto-has-made-5-attempts-to-host-the-olympics-could-the-sixth-be-the-winner.html</ref> The Athens bid was based on the fact that 1996 marked 100 years since the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first Summer Games in Greece in 1896]]. The initial push for 1996 coming to Atlanta came from [[Billy Payne]] and then Atlanta mayor [[Andrew Young]], whose main push for the Olympics to come to Atlanta mainly came from a motivation to showcase a changed and resurgent [[Southern United States|American South]] which was overcoming racial tensions from the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|African American civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s and to showcase a robust and growing Southern economy to help offset international stereotypes that the region was still plagued with poverty.<ref>{{cite web|title=1996 Olympic Games|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2042|publisher=Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>

===Costs===
The 1996 Olympics was predicated on the financial model established by the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The cost to stage the Games was [[United States dollar|US$]]1.8&nbsp;billion.  U.S. Government funds were used for security, and around $500 Million of taxpayer money was used on the physical infrastructure including streetscaping, road improvements, Centennial Olympic Park, expansion of airport, improvements in public transportation, and redevelopment of public housing projects<ref>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Legacy in Atlanta – [1999&#93; UNSWLJ 38; (1999) 22(3) University of New South Wales Law Journal 902|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/1999/38.html#Heading21|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5heLTjqoP|archivedate=June 19, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> but neither paid for the actual Games and the new Venues themselves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/04/weekinreview/so-you-want-to-hold-an-olympics.html?pagewanted=print|title=So, You Want to Hold an Olympics |accessdate=August 17, 2008 |date=August 4, 1996 |last=Applebome |first=Peter |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> To pay for the games, Atlanta relied on commercial sponsorship and ticket sales, resulting in a profit of $10 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/sports/111340.htm |title=Beijing Olympiad: Profit or Loss? |accessdate=August 17, 2008 |publisher=China Internet Information Center| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917161938/http://www1.china.org.cn/english/sports/111340.htm| archivedate= September 17, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>{{Better source|date=June 2012}}

The Olympiad's official theme, "Summon the Heroes," was written by [[John Williams (composer)|John Williams]], making it the third Olympiad at that point for which he had composed (official composer 1984; NBC's coverage composer 1988). The [[1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] featured [[Céline Dion]] singing [[The Power of the Dream]], the official theme song of the 1996 Olympics. The [[mascot]] for the Olympiad was an abstract, animated character named [[Izzy (Mascot)|Izzy]]. In contrast to the standing tradition of mascots of national or regional significance in the city hosting the Olympiad, Izzy was an amorphous, fantasy figure. The 1996 Olympics were the first to have two separate opening ceremony events. [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], because of its geographical separation from Atlanta, had its own opening ceremonies on July 18, 1996. The event featured "Worldwide Connection," a song composed by Savannah native Jeffrey Reed and a concert by [[Trisha Yearwood]], a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] native.

Atlanta's Olympic slogan "Come Celebrate Our Dream" was written by Jack Arogeti, a Managing Director at [[McCann Erickson|McCann-Erickson]] in Atlanta at the time. The slogan was selected from more than 5,000<ref>{{cite news|title=Atlanta Redefines Image With 'Come Celebrate Our Dream' Slogan|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950219&slug=2105823|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=February 19, 1995}}</ref>  submitted by the public to the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. [[William Porter Payne|Billy Payne]] noted that Jack "captured the spirit and our true motivation for the Olympic games."<ref>{{cite web|title=Congratulations Note from Billy Payne|url=http://olympicsloganinfo.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/note-from-billy-payne-to-jack-arogeti/paynearogetiolympics/}}</ref>

===Opening ceremony===
{{main|1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}
The ceremony began with a flashback from Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]] closing ceremony in August 1992 which showed the then president of the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] asking the athletes to compete in Atlanta in 1996. Then, spirits rose in the northwest corner of the stadium, each representing one of the colors in the Olympic rings. They called the tribes of the world which after mixed percussion formed the Olympic rings while the youth of Atlanta formed the number 100. Famed film composer [[John Williams]] composed the official overture for the 1996 Olympics, [[Summon the Heroes]], his second overture for an Olympic games (the first being [[Olympic Fanfare and Theme]] written for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]).  The song "[[The Power of the Dream]]", composed by [[David Foster]], was performed by [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]] accompanied by [[David Foster]] on the piano, the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and the Centennial Choir ([[Morehouse College Glee Club]], [[Spelman College|Spelman College Glee Club]] and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus). [[Gladys Knight]] sang "[[Georgia on My Mind]]", Georgia's official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]]. There was also a showcase called "Welcome To The World", which featured [[cheerleader]]s, [[Chevrolet]] [[pickup truck|pick-up]] trucks, [[marching band]]s, and [[Stepping (African-American)|steppers]], showcasing the American youth and college sporting culture, including [[Wave (audience)|the wave]] commonly seen in sporting events around the world. A showcase entitled "Summertime" focused on Atlanta and the Old South with a placement on its beauty, spirit, music, history, culture, and rebirth after the [[American Civil War]]. [[Muhammad Ali]] lit the Olympic torch during the opening ceremonies of the games and received a replacement gold medal for his boxing victory in the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. For the torch ceremony, more than 10,000 [[Olympic flame|Olympic torches]] were manufactured by the [[American Meter Company]] and electroplated by [[Erie Plating Company]]. Each torch weighed about {{convert|3.5|lb|kg}} and was made primarily of aluminum, with a Georgia [[pecan]] wood handle and gold ornamentation.<ref>[[Erie Times-News]], "Erie Company's Olympic Work Shines", June 10, 1996, by Greg Lavine</ref><ref>Plating and Surface Finishing Magazine, August 1996 Issue</ref>

In women's gymnastics, [[Lilia Podkopayeva]] became the all-around Olympic champion. Podkopayeva also won a second gold medal in the floor exercise final and a silver on the beam — becoming the only female gymnast since [[Nadia Comăneci]] to win an individual event gold after winning the all-round title in the same Olympics. [[Kerri Strug]] of the United States women's gymnastics team vaulted with an injured ankle and landed on one foot. The US women's gymnastics team won its first gold medal. [[Shannon Miller]] of the United States won the gold medal on the balance beam event, the first time an American gymnast had won an individual gold medal in a non-boycotted Olympic games. The Spanish team won the first gold medal in the new competition of [[Gymnastics at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's rhythmic group all-around|women's rhythmic group all-around]]. The team was formed by [[Estela Giménez]], [[Marta Baldó]], [[Nuria Cabanillas]], [[Lorena Guréndez]], [[Estíbaliz Martínez]] and [[Tania Lamarca]].

[[Amy Van Dyken]] won four gold medals in the Olympic [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] pool, the first American woman to win four titles in a single Olympiad. [[Penny Heyns]], swimmer of South Africa, won the gold medals in both the 100 metres and 200 metres breaststroke events. [[Michelle Smith]] of Ireland won three gold medals and a bronze in swimming. She remains her nation's most decorated Olympian. However, her victories were overshadowed by [[doping (sport)|doping]] allegations even though she did not test positive in 1996. She received a four-year suspension in 1998 for tampering with a urine sample, though her medals and records were allowed to stand.
[[File:JO Atlanta 1996 - Stade.jpg|thumb|left|Women's 100 m hurdles at the Olympic stadium]]
In track and field, [[Donovan Bailey]] of Canada won the men's 100 m, setting a new world record of 9.84&nbsp;seconds at that time. He also anchored his team's gold in the [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's 4 × 100 metres relay|4 × 100 m relay]].
[[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] won gold in both the 200&nbsp;m and 400 m, setting a new world record of 19.32&nbsp;seconds in the 200 m. Johnson afterward began disputing Bailey's unofficial title as the "world's fastest man", which later culminated in a [[Bailey-Johnson 150-metre race|150-metre race]] between the two to settle the issue. [[Marie-José Pérec]] equaled Johnson's performance, although without a world record, by winning the rare 200 m/400&nbsp;m double. [[Carl Lewis]] won his 4th long jump gold medal at the age of 35.

In tennis, [[Andre Agassi]] won the gold medal, which would eventually make him the first man and second singles player overall (after his wife, [[Steffi Graf]]) to win the career [[Golden Slam]], which consists of an Olympic gold medal and victories in the singles tournaments held at professional tennis' four major events ([[Australian Open]], [[French Open]], [[The Championships Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]).
[[File:JO Atlanta 1996 - Drapeau.jpg|thumb|The Olympic flag waves at the 1996 games]]
There were a series of national firsts realized during the Games. [[Deon Hemmings]] became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal for [[Jamaica]] and the English-speaking [[West Indies]]. [[Lee Lai Shan]] won a gold medal in sailing, the only Olympic medal that [[Hong Kong]] ever won as a British colony (1852–1997). This meant that for the only time, the colonial flag of Hong Kong was raised to the accompaniment of the British national anthem [[God Save the Queen]], as Hong Kong's [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|sovereignty]] was later transferred to China in 1997. The US women's [[soccer]] team won the gold medal in the first ever women's [[soccer]] event. For the first time, Olympic medals were won by athletes from [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Burundi]], [[Ecuador]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Mozambique]], [[Slovakia]], [[Tonga]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. Another first in Atlanta was that this was the first Olympics ever that not a single nation swept all three medals in a single event.

==Appraisal==
Atlanta's heavy reliance on corporate sponsorship caused European Olympic officials to consider the Games to be overly commercialized. [[Coca-Cola]], whose corporate headquarters is in Atlanta, received criticism for being the exclusive drink offered in Olympic venues.<ref>{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Coke's Hometown Olympics;The Company Tries the Big Blitz on Its Own Turf|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/28/business/coke-s-hometown-olympics-the-company-tries-the-big-blitz-on-its-own-turf.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref>  In addition, the city of Atlanta was found to have been competing with the IOC for advertising and sponsorship dollars. The city licensed street vendors who sold certain products over others, and therefore provided a presence for companies who were not official Olympic sponsors.<ref name="mcgill1">[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2901/pound.htm McGill's master of the rings]</ref><ref name="Commercials">[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2001/11/05/story3.html?page=2 Olympic bid smacks into $10M hurdle] – fact mentioned in the 5th paragraph</ref>

A report prepared by European Olympic officials after the Games was critical of Atlanta's performance in several key issues, including the level of crowding in the Olympic Village, the quality of available food, the accessibility and convenience of transportation, and the Games' general atmosphere of commercialism.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympic-games-maligned-atlanta-meets-targets-1352491.html |title=Olympic Games: Maligned Atlanta meets targets |date=November 15, 1996 |work=The Independent |location=United Kingdom |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5q0EnQ16f |archivedate=October 25, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2010}}</ref> The opening ceremony, featuring 500 [[cheerleading|cheerleader]]s and 30 [[pickup truck]]s, was also seen as "garish" by some observers and considered questionable in taste by many foreign visitors, and many American spectators claim it had nothing to do with [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/events/1996/olympics/commemorative/day1.html|title=From Garish to Grand on Opening Night Day|accessdate=April 3, 2010 | work=CNN}}</ref>

At the [[1996 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]], [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] said in his closing speech, "Well done, Atlanta" and simply called the Games "most exceptional." This broke precedent for Samaranch, who had traditionally labeled each Games "the best Olympics ever" at each closing ceremony, a practice he resumed at the subsequent [[2000 Summer Olympics|Games in Sydney in 2000]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/oly/summer00/news/2000/1001/794339.html|title=Samaranch calls these Olympics 'best ever'

==Centennial Olympic Park bombing==
{{Main|Centennial Olympic Park bombing}}
[[File:The marker at the entrance to Olympic Park in Atlanta.jpg|42.0 KBpx|framed|right|The marker at the entrance to Centennial Park in downtown Atlanta]]
The 1996 Olympics were marred by the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]] on July 27.  Security Guard [[Richard Jewell]] discovered the pipe bomb and immediately notified law enforcement and helped evacuate as many people as possible from the area before it exploded.  Although Jewell's quick actions are credited for saving many lives, the bombing killed spectator Alice Hawthorne, wounded 111 others, and caused the death of Melih Uzunyol by heart attack. Jewell was later considered a suspect (but never charged) in the bombing but was exonerated in October 1996. In 2003, [[Eric Robert Rudolph]] was charged with and confessed to this bombing as well as the bombings of several [[abortion clinic]]s and [[gay bar]]s. He stated "the purpose of the attack on July 27th was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand."<ref>{{Cite web|title = On This Day: Bomb Explodes in Atlanta's Olympic Park|url = http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/July-August-08/On-this-Day--Bomb-Explodes-in-Atlanta-s-Olympic-Park.html|website = www.findingdulcinea.com|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}</ref> He was sentenced to a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] at [[ADX Florence]] prison in [[Florence, Colorado]].

Preparations for the Olympics lasted more than six years and had an economic impact of at least $5.14 billion. Over two million visitors came to Atlanta, and approximately 3.5 billion people around the world watched part of the games on television. Although marred by the tragedy of the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]], they were a financial success, due in part to TV rights contracts and sponsorships at record levels.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-09-21/news/0909200352_1_centennial-olympic-games-billy-payne-atlanta-committee |title=Olympics' impact on Atlanta still subject to debate |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |first=Dahleen |last=Glanton}}</ref>  [[William Porter Payne]] and [[Steve Spinner]] led the U.S. marketing program which became a model for future Games.

Beyond international recognition, the Games resulted in many modern infrastructure improvements. The mid-rise dormitories built for the Olympic Village, which became the first residential housing for [[Georgia State University]] (Georgia State Village), are now used by the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (North Avenue Apartments). Centennial Olympic Stadium was converted into [[Turner Field]], which became the new home of the [[Atlanta Braves]] baseball team starting with their 1997 season. The Braves' former home, [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium]], was demolished and the site became a parking lot for Turner Field. The [[Omni Coliseum]] was demolished that same year to make way for [[Philips Arena]]. [[Centennial Olympic Park]], which was built for the events, is the city's lasting memorial of the games. The park initiated a revitalization of the surrounding area, and now serves as the hub for Atlanta's tourism district.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>
