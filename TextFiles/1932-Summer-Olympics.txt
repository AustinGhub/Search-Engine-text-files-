The '''1932 Summer Olympics''', officially known as the '''Games of the X Olympiad''', was a major worldwide multi-athletic event which was celebrated in 1932 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]]. No other cities made a bid to host these Olympics. Held during the worldwide [[Great Depression]], many nations and athletes were unable to pay for the trip to Los Angeles. Fewer than half the participants of the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in Amsterdam returned to compete in 1932. Even U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]] skipped the event.<ref name=Zarnowski>Hoover, who also skipped the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]], was the second U.S. president to miss a Games in the United States held during his term. The first was President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who decided not to attend the [[1904 Summer Olympics]], held in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], because [[Mayor of St. Louis|St. Louis mayor]] [[David R. Francis]] declined to let Roosevelt help officiate. {{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C.

The organizing committee put no record of the finances of the Games in their report, though contemporary newspapers reported that the Games had made a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] of US$1,000,000.<ref name=Zarnowski/>

==Host city selection==
The selection process for the 1932 Summer Olympics consisted of one bid, from Los Angeles, which ultimately hosted the games. The selection was made at the 23rd IOC Session in Rome, Italy, in 1923.<ref name=votes>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xFvf0ufx |archivedate=March 17, 2011}}</ref>

==Highlights==

* An [[Olympic Village]] was built for the first time, in [[Baldwin Hills]], occupied by the male athletes.<ref>[http://www.baldwinhillspark.info/olympicvillage.html 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Athlete's Village in Baldwin Hills], ''Accessed November 12, 2007.''</ref>  Female athletes were housed at the Chapman Park Hotel on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].
* The victory podium was used for the first time.<ref name=NPS-LANDMARK>[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1884&ResourceType=Structure Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum], National Landmarks Program, National Park Service, ''Accessed November 12, 2007.''</ref>
* The [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] was known in 1932 as ''Olympic Stadium''.
* Tenth Street, a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles, was renamed [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]] in honor of the Games of the Tenth Olympiad.
* [[Babe Didrikson]] won two gold medals in the [[javelin throw|javelin]] and the hurdles event. She also competed in a jump-off for a silver in the high jump. Her technique in the jump-off was ruled illegal, leaving Didrikson with second place.
* In [[field hockey]], only three nations took part. The host nation lost both matches, 1-24 to India and 2-9 to Japan, but still won a bronze medal.
* Poland's [[Stanisława Walasiewicz]] won the gold medal in the women's 100 m; she would also win the silver medal in the event four years later. After her death in 1980, it was discovered that she was [[intersex]] and would have been ineligible to participate.
* The executive council of the IAAF suspended [[Paavo Nurmi]] from international amateur athletics four months before the Games, pending an investigation into his amateur status.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] | title=Finns Aroused by Nurmi Suspension | date=April 4, 1932 | page=7 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tLgwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Dk4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5140,3528245&dq=paavo+nurmi&hl=en | accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref> Less than three days before the [[Athletics at the 1932 Summer Olympics – Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 m]], the seven members of the council formed a special commission and rejected his entries.<ref>{{cite news | first=Alan | last=Gould | newspaper=[[Telegraph Herald]] | title=Paavo Nurmi barred from Olympic meet | date=July 29, 1932 | page=11 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kONFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EL4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3666,6782915&dq=nurmi&hl=en | accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>
* [[Eddie Tolan]] won both the 100 m and 200 m sprint events.
* [[Romeo Neri]] won three gold medals in gymnastics.
* [[Helene Madison]] won three gold medals in swimming, while the Japanese upset the men's events and took all but one title.
* [[Takeichi Nishi]] (Baron Nishi) was the gold medalist with his horse Uranus in the equestrian [[Equestrian at the 1932 Summer Olympics|show jumping individual event]]. Nishi's gold medal is Japan's only gold medal in the equestrian event to this day.  Nishi would later die in 1945 as an officer stationed in the defense of the island of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], and as such is a main character in [[Clint Eastwood]]'s film, ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''.
* [[Kusuo Kitamura]] won the gold medal in the men's 1500 meter freestyle swimming race. He was and continues to be the youngest ever male swimmer to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games.
* [[Dunc Gray]] won Australia's first cycling gold medal; he set a world record of 1m 13s in the 1000 [[Track time trial|time trial]]. The [[Dunc Gray Velodrome]], built for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympic Games]], was named after him.
* Due to an official's error, the [[Athletics at the 1932 Summer Olympics – Men's 3000 metres steeplechase|3,000 m steeplechase]] went for 3,460 m, or one extra lap.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Steven|title=What was unusual about the 3000-metre steeplechase final at the 1932 Olympics?|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/espn/sport/story/117592.html|work=www.espn.co.uk|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>
