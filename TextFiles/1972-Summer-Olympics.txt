The '''1972 Summer Olympics''' (German: ''Olympische Sommerspiele 1972''), officially known as the '''Games of the XX Olympiad''', was an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] held in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], from August 26 to September 11, 1972.

The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in which eleven [[Israel]]i athletes and coaches and a West German police officer were killed.  Five [[Black September (group)|Black September]] Palestinian terrorists died.

The 1972 Summer Olympics were the second [[Summer Olympics]] to be held in Germany, after the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]] in [[Berlin]], which had taken place under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Mindful of the connection, the West German Government was eager to take the opportunity of the Munich Olympics to present a new, democratic and optimistic Germany to the world, as shown by the Games' official motto, "Die Heiteren Spiele",<ref name="DER SPIEGEL 35/1972">{{cite news|title=Ein Geschenk der Deutschen an sich selbst|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42872049.html|publisher=DER SPIEGEL 35/1972|date=August 21, 1972|quote=… für die versprochene Heiterkeit der Spiele, die den Berliner Monumentalismus von 1936 vergessen machen und dem Image der Bundesrepublik in aller Welt aufhelfen sollen}}</ref> or "the cheerful Games".<ref>{{cite book|title=Digitized version of the Official Report of the Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXth Olympiad Munich 1972 (Volume 2)|date=1972|language=de|publisher=proSport GmbH & Co.

The Olympic Park (''[[Olympiapark]]'') is based on [[Frei Otto]]'s plans and after the Games became a Munich landmark. The competition sites, designed by architect [[Günther Behnisch]], included the Olympic swimming hall, the Olympics Hall (''Olympiahalle'', a multipurpose facility) and the [[Olympic Stadium, Munich|Olympic Stadium]] (''Olympiastadion''), and an Olympic village very close to the park. The design of the stadium was considered revolutionary, with sweeping canopies of [[acrylic glass]] stabilized by metal ropes, used on such a large scale for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Uhrig|first1=Klaus|title=Die gebaute Utopie: Das Münchner Olympiastadion|url=http://www.br.de/fernsehen/ard-alpha/sendungen/schulfernsehen/kunst-olympiastadion-muenchen100.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|date=March 20, 2014|language=de}}</ref>

Munich won its Olympic bid on April 26, 1966, at the 64th [[IOC Session]] at [[Rome]], [[Italy]], over bids presented by Detroit, Madrid, and Montréal. Montreal would eventually host the following [[1976 Summer Olympics|Olympic games in 1976]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html|title=IOC VOTE HISTORY|work=aldaver.com}}</ref>

== Munich massacre ==
{{Main|Munich massacre}}
The Games were largely overshadowed by what has come to be known as the "Munich massacre". On September 5, a group of eight members of the [[Black September (group)|Black September]] Palestinian terrorist organization broke into the [[Olympic Village]] and took nine Israeli athletes, coaches and officials hostage in their apartments. Two of the hostages who resisted were killed in the first moments of the break-in; the subsequent standoff in the Olympic Village lasted for almost 18 hours.

Late in the evening of September 5, the terrorists and their hostages were transferred by helicopter to the military airport of [[Fürstenfeldbruck]], ostensibly to board a plane bound for an undetermined Arab country. The German authorities planned to ambush them there, but underestimated the numbers of their opposition and were thus undermanned. During a botched rescue attempt, all of the Israeli hostages were killed. Four of them were shot, then incinerated when one of the terrorists detonated a grenade inside the helicopter in which the hostages were sitting. The five remaining hostages were then machine-gunned to death.

All but three of the terrorists were killed as well. Although arrested and imprisoned pending trial, they were released by the West German government on October 29, 1972, in exchange for a hijacked [[Lufthansa]] jet. Two of those three were supposedly hunted down and assassinated later by the [[Mossad]].<ref name=Calahan>[https://fas.org/irp/eprint/calahan.htm Countering Terrorism: The Israeli Response To The 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre And The Development Of Independence Covert Action Teams], M.A. thesis by Alexander B. Calahan at Marine Corps Command and Staff College, 1995.</ref> [[Jamal Al-Gashey]], who is believed to be the sole survivor, is still living today in hiding in an unspecified African country with his wife and two children. The Olympic events were suspended several hours after the initial attack, but once the incident was concluded, [[Avery Brundage]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] president, declared that "the Games must go on". A memorial ceremony was then held in the Olympic stadium, and the competitions resumed after a stoppage of 24 hours. The attack prompted heightened security at subsequent Olympics beginning with the [[1976 Winter Olympics]]. Security at Olympics was heightened further beginning with the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], as they were the first to take place since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].

The massacre led the German federal government to re-examine its anti-terrorism policies, which at the time were dominated by a pacifist approach adopted after World War II. This led to the creation of the elite counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]], similar to the [[British SAS]]. It also led Israel to launch an aggressive campaign known as [[Operation Wrath of God]], in which those suspected of involvement were systematically tracked down and assassinated.

The events of the Munich massacre were chronicled in the Oscar-winning documentary, ''[[One Day in September]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movies {{ndash}} One Day in September (1999)|last1=Deming|first1=Mark|url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/186705/One-Day-in-September/overview|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref> An account of the aftermath is also dramatized in three films: the 1976 made-for-TV movie ''[[21 Hours at Munich]]'', the 1986 made-for-TV movie ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Television {{ndash}} Sword of Gideon|url=http://www.nytimes.com/tv/show/62766/Sword-of-Gideon/overview|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref> and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2005 film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=An Action Film About the Need to Talk|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/23/movies/23muni.html?_r=0|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref> In her film ''1972'', Artist [[Sarah Morris]] interviews Dr. Georg Sieber, a former police psychiatrist who advised the Olympics' security team, about the events and aftermath of Black September.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Herbert|first1=Martin|title=Sarah Morris|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/sarah_morris2/|website=frieze.com|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref>

== Highlights ==
[[File:Olympic games 1972 pictogramms olympic station 0877 a.jpg|thumb|width100px|[[Otl Aicher]]'s signage pictograms designed for the Munich Olympic Games]]
* These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of [[Avery Brundage]].
* [[Mark Spitz]], a swimmer from the United States, set a [[world record]] when he won seven gold medals (while on the way to setting a new world record for each of his seven gold medals) in a single Olympics, bringing his lifetime total to nine (he had won two golds in [[1968 Summer Olympics|Mexico City's Games]] four years earlier). Being [[Jewish]], Spitz was asked to leave Munich before the closing ceremonies for his own protection, after fears arose that he would be an additional target of those responsible for the [[Munich massacre]]. Spitz's record stood until [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], when it was beaten by [[Michael Phelps]] who won 8 gold medals in the pool.
* [[Olga Korbut]], a [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|Soviet]] [[gymnastics|gymnast]], became a media star after winning a gold medal in the team competition event, failing to win in the individual all-around after a fall (she was beaten by [[Lyudmilla Turischeva]]), and finally winning two gold medals in the [[Gymnastics balance beam|Balance Beam]] and the [[Gymnastics floor|floor exercise]] events.
* In the [[1972 Olympic Men's Basketball Final|final of the men's basketball]], the United States lost to the [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|Soviet Union]], in what [[USA Basketball]] calls "the most controversial game in international basketball history".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_1972.html |title= USA Basketball |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822182059/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_1972.html |archivedate=2007-08-22}}</ref> In a close-fought match, the U.S. team had initially won with a score of 50–49. However, due to confusing signals from the scorer's table, the final 3 seconds of the game were replayed twice and the Soviet team was able to regain the lead and claim a 51-50 victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=120 years, 120 stories (Part 15) : Soviets beat the Americans amidst controversies involving communist judges|url=http://sports-nova.com/2016/03/04/120-years-120-stories-part-15-soviets-beat-americans-amidst-controversies-involving-communist-judges/|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Ultimately the U.S team refused to accept their silver medals, which remain held in a vault in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]].
* [[Lasse Virén]] of Finland won the 5,000 and 10,000&nbsp;m (the latter after a fall), a feat he repeated in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].
* [[Valeriy Borzov]] of the Soviet Union won both the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m in [[track and field]]. The top two US sprinters and medal favorites in the 100&nbsp;m, [[Rey Robinson]] and [[Eddie Hart (athlete)|Eddie Hart]], missed their quarter final heats after being given the wrong starting time.
* Two American 400&nbsp;m runners, [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] and [[Wayne Collett]], acted casually on the medal stand, twirled their medals (gold and silver, respectively), joked with one another and did not face the American flag as "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was being played during the award ceremony. They were banned from the Olympics for life, as [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] had been in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. Since [[John Smith (athlete)|John Smith]] had pulled a hamstring in the final and had been ruled unfit to run, the United States were forced to scratch from the 4×400&nbsp;m relay.
* [[Dave Wottle]] won the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Men's 800 metres|men's 800 m]], after being last for the first 600&nbsp;m, at which point he started to pass runner after runner up the final straightaway, finally grabbing the lead in the final 18 metres to win by 0.03 seconds ahead of the favorite, the Soviet [[Yevgeny Arzhanov]]. At the victory ceremony, Wottle forgot to remove his golf cap. This was interpreted by some as a form of protest against the Vietnam War, but Wottle later apologized.
* Australian swimmer [[Shane Gould]] won three gold medals, a silver, and a bronze medal at the age of 15.
* [[Team handball|Handball]] (last held in 1936) and [[Archery]] (last held in 1920) returned as Olympic sports after a long absence.
* [[Slalom canoeing]] was held for the first time at the Olympics.
* [[Dan Gable]] won the gold medal in [[sport wrestling|wrestling]] without having a single point scored against him. No other athlete has ever accomplished such a feat in Olympic wrestling.
* [[Wim Ruska]] became the first [[judoka]] to win two gold medals.
* For the first time, the [[Olympic Oath]] was taken by a representative of the referees.
* American [[Frank Shorter]], who was born in Munich, became the first from his country in 64 years to win the Olympic marathon. As Shorter was nearing the stadium, German student Norbert Sudhaus entered the stadium wearing a track uniform, joined the race and ran the last kilometre; thinking he was the winner, the crowd began cheering him before officials realized the hoax and security escorted Sudhaus off the track. Arriving seconds later, Shorter was understandably perplexed to see someone ahead of him and to hear the boos and catcalls meant for Sudhaus. This was the third time in Olympic history that an American had won the marathon (after [[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]] 1904 and [[Johnny Hayes]] 1908) — and in none of those three instances did the winner enter the stadium first.

The Parade of Nations was organised according to the German alphabet, with the first country following Greece being Egypt, whilst East Germany was referred to as "DDR".<ref>{{YouTube|xwBrMgMM_2g|Munich 1972 Opening Ceremony}}</ref>

[[Rhodesia at the Olympics|Rhodesia]]'s invitation to take part in the 1972 Summer Games was withdrawn by the [[International Olympic Committee]] four days before the opening ceremony, in response to African countries' protests against the Rhodesian government. (Rhodesia did, however, [[Rhodesia at the 1972 Summer Paralympics|compete]] in the [[1972 Summer Paralympics]], held a little earlier in [[Heidelberg]].)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/22/newsid_3549000/3549444.stm "1972: Rhodesia out of Olympics"]</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19720823&id=FgsyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w6EFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1790,5361674 "Rhodesia expelled", ''Montreal Gazette'', August 23, 1972]</ref>
