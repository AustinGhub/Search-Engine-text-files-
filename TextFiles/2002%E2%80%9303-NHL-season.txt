The '''2002–03 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|86th]] [[regular season]] of the [[National Hockey League]].  The [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup winners]] were the [[New Jersey Devils]], who won the best of seven series 4–3 against the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]].

==Regular season==
As always, the regular season saw several surprises.  The [[San Jose Sharks]], who many felt would be one of the elite teams in the West, stumbled early and badly disassembled much of the team.  The two-year-old [[Minnesota Wild]], on the other hand, got out to an early start and held onto their first-ever playoff berth throughout the season, winning coach [[Jacques Lemaire]] the [[Jack Adams Award]].

The elite teams of previous years such as the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[St. Louis Blues]], [[Colorado Avalanche]] and [[New Jersey Devils]], were joined by two younger Canadian teams, the [[Ottawa Senators]] and [[Vancouver Canucks]]. The [[Dallas Stars]], which had missed the playoffs the year before, returned as a major power, backed by the record-setting goaltending of [[Marty Turco]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The most surprising team was probably the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], which many had predicted to finish last, winning their first Southeast Division title and making the playoffs for the first time in seven years.  The most disappointing teams, other than the Sharks, were the [[New York Rangers]], who finished out of the playoffs again despite bearing the league's leading payroll, and the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], who finished last overall after a surprise run to the [[Stanley Cup]] Final the year before. On January 8, 2003, [[Chicago Blackhawks]] goaltender [[Michael Leighton]] gained a shutout in his NHL debut in a 0–0 tie versus the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]]. Coyotes goaltender [[Zac Bierk]] earned his first career shutout, although it was not his NHL debut. It was the first—and with the abolition of ties two years later, the only—time that two goalies in the same game both earned their first career shutouts.<ref>Hockey’s Book of Firsts, p.19, James Duplacey, JG Press, ISBN 978-1-57215-037-9</ref>

At the midpoint of the season, the Canucks lead the Western Conference and Ottawa lead the East. Vancouver stumbled somewhat over the stretch and lost the Northwest Division title to Colorado and the Western Conference to Dallas. Ottawa continued to dominate, having the best season in franchise history and winning both the Eastern Conference and the [[Presidents' Trophy]].

The season was also marred by financial difficulties. Despite their success, the Ottawa Senators were in bankruptcy protection for almost all of 2003, and at one point could not pay the players.  Owner [[Rod Bryden]] tried a variety of innovative financing strategies, but these all failed and the team was purchased after the season by billionaire [[Eugene Melnyk]].  The [[Buffalo Sabres]] also entered bankruptcy protection before being bought by New York businessman [[Tom Golisano]].  The financial struggles of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] continued as the team continued to unload its most expensive players.

The season was marked by a great number of coaches being fired, from [[Bob Hartley]] in Colorado to [[Darryl Sutter]] in San Jose and [[Bryan Trottier]] of the [[New York Rangers]].

Worries over the decline in scoring and the [[neutral zone trap]] continued.  The season began with an attempted crack down on obstruction and interference, but by the midpoint of the season this effort had petered out.

'''''Note:''' All dates in 2003.''

The [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs]] was one of shocking upsets in the Western Conference and hard fought battles in the Eastern Conference.

The most closely watched series in the first round was that between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. Two teams built around physical play with high [[salary]] and front-page trade deadline acquisitions. The series did not disappoint and the Flyers ousted the Leafs in seven games. The Senators easily dispatched the [[New York Islanders]], who had traded away their starting [[goaltender]] ([[Chris Osgood]]) before the playoffs. Despite losing the first two games, [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Tampa Bay]] rallied and defeated their division rival the [[Washington Capitals]]. [[New Jersey Devils|New Jersey]] easily defeated the [[Boston Bruins]], effectively shutting down star player [[Joe Thornton]].

In the west, the first round was one of unmitigated shock to all hockey watchers. The defending champions and perennial cup favourite [[Detroit Red Wings]] were swept by the underdog [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] behind the goaltending of [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]]. After losing three out of the first four games, the [[Minnesota Wild]] came back and defeated the powerhouse [[Colorado Avalanche]] in game seven. [[Vancouver Canucks|Vancouver]] also lost three of its first four games with the [[St. Louis Blues]], but then rallied and won game seven. The only round that surprised no one was round seven of the [[Dallas Stars]]-[[Edmonton Oilers]] grudge match that saw the first place Stars oust the Oilers with only some difficulty.

The second round in the west brought more upsets. The Minnesota Wild again fell 3–1 behind while playing Vancouver, but rallied and defeated them in seven games. Giguère's stellar goaltending continued to triumph as the Ducks ousted the Stars in six games. The Western Conference final was a meeting of two dark horse teams, but the superb goaltending of Giguère and the Ducks triumphed over the tight checking of the Minnesota Wild. This was the first time since 1994 that a team other than Detroit, Colorado, or Dallas had won the Western conference and earned a trip to the Stanley Cup Final. These playoffs also signaled an end to the dominance of the afore mentioned three teams and shift the balance of power in the Western conference towards teams like Anaheim and San Jose. Of Detroit, Colorado, and Dallas only Detroit has returned to the Stanley Cup Final since, winning the Stanley Cup in 2008 and losing the Final to Pittsburgh in 2009.

The east was far more predictable as Tampa Bay's youth showed when playing the grizzled veterans of the New Jersey Devils and the Ottawa Senators dispatched a tired Flyers team for the second year in a row. The Eastern Conference finals were a contrast of styles between the offensively explosive Senators and the defense minded Devils. The Devils came out to an early lead in the series, Ottawa rallied, winning games five and six on the energizing play of rookie [[Jason Spezza]], but then the Devils regained their form as goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] helped them win game seven and advance to the Stanley Cup Final for the third time in four years.

===Final===
{{main|2003 Stanley Cup Finals}}
The Stanley Cup Final was a duel between two elite goaltenders, but after seven games the Devils triumphed to win their third Cup in seven years.  The series also saw [[Scott Stevens]] land one of his prototypical crushing hits on Anaheim captain [[Paul Kariya]], similar to the one that had knocked out [[Eric Lindros]], then of the Flyers in the [[1999–2000 NHL season|2000]] Playoffs.  Unlike Lindros, Kariya returned to the game only ten minutes later and scored.
