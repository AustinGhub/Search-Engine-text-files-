'''1. Fußball-Club Köln 01/07 e. V.''', commonly known as simply '''1. FC Köln''' or '''FC Cologne''' in English ({{IPA-de|ʔɛf ˈtseː ˈkœln}}), is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Cologne]]. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs ''Kölner Ballspiel-Club 1901'' and ''SpVgg Sülz 07''. Köln play in the [[Bundesliga]], the highest league of German football.

The club's nickname ''Die Geißböcke'' ("The [[Goat|Billy Goats]]") refers to the club's [[mascot]], a male goat named ''Hennes'' after the veteran FC player and (later) manager [[Hennes Weisweiler]]. The first ''Hennes'' was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a [[Cologne carnival]] joke. The current mascot is ''Hennes'' VIII, and has been since 24 July 2006. Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is ''FC'' (often written as ''Effzeh''), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the [[Colognian language|dialect spoken around Cologne]], this is pronounced "EF-tsay",{{fix|text=Colognian IPA needed|date=October 2015}} in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ({{IPA-de|ʔɛf ˈtseː|}}).

Like many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC Köln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like [[Team handball|handball]], table tennis and gymnastics. 1. FC Köln had around 78.500 members {{as of|2016|05|lc=y}}, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.express.de/fc-koeln/74-767-sind-dabei--mitglieder-boom--der-1--fc-koeln-hat-nun-auch-den-hsv-ueberholt,3192,32064454.html | title = Mitglieder-Boom: 1.

==History==
===Predecessor sides===
[[File:Kolner BC.png|thumb|left|250px|Historical logos of predecessor side ''Kölner BC'']]'''Kölner BC''' was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the [[gymnastics]] club FC Borussia Köln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before [[World War I]] who took the [[Western German football championship|Westdeutsche championship]] in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the [[1912 German football championship|national finals]]. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost a 1–3 to [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].

[[File:SpVgg Sulz.png|thumb|right|100px|Historical logo of predecessor side ''SpVgg Sülz'']]
'''Spielvereinigung 1907 Köln-Sülz''' was established in 1907 as Sülzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fußball Club 1908 Hertha Sülz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the [[1928 German football championship|national finals]] in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the [[Gauliga Mittelrhein]], one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s&nbsp;– including a divisional championship in 1939&nbsp;– but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the [[Gauliga Köln-Aachen]] and the [[Gauliga Moselland]], which included clubs from occupied [[Luxembourg]]. Sülz struggled until they were united with [[VfL Köln 1899]] for the 1943–44 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/Sülz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga Köln-Aachen title by a single point over SG Düren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.

===A successful new club===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
After the union of these two predecessor sides, '''1. FC Köln''' began play in the tough [[Oberliga West (1947–63)|Oberliga West]] in the 1949–50 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the [[1953–54 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final 1–0 to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. ''Die Geißböcke'' won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the [[1960 German football championship|national final]] against [[Hamburger SV]], where they went down to a 2–3 defeat. They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in [[1962 German football championship|1962]] and [[1963 German football championship|1963]]. They won the '62 match 4–0 over [[1. FC Nürnberg]] resulting in entry to the [[1962–63 European Cup]] where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round Köln visited [[Dundee F.C.]] of [[Scotland]] and lost 1–8, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4–0 they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final they lost 1–3 to [[Borussia Dortmund]].

===Continuing success===
In 1963, FC Köln was selected as one of the original sixteen teams to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. Köln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga champion]] in the league's inaugural [[1963–64 Bundesliga|1963–64 season]]. As German champions, Köln entered the [[1964–65 European Cup]] where they met England's [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the quarter-final stage. After two 0–0 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2–2. As the [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]] had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, Köln went out of the competition on the [[Coin toss|toss of a coin]]. Ironically enough there was the need for a second coin toss, because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground. The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player when it signed [[Zézé]] for a then club record fee of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 150,000.<ref name="Schnee" >[http://www.weltfussball.de/news/_n1498951_/schnee-allergie-beim-samba-kicker/ Schnee-Allergie beim Samba-Kicker] {{de icon}} Weltfussball.de, published: 27 March 2015, accessed: 28 March 2015</ref> Domestically, Köln recorded a second-place finish in the [[1964–65 Bundesliga]] season and won its first [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1967–68 DFB-Pokal|1967–68]].

At the start of the 1970s, Köln reached three [[DFB-Pokal]] finals in four seasons, losing all three; to [[Kickers Offenbach]] in [[1969–70 DFB-Pokal|1970]], [[FC Bayern Munich]] in [[1970–71 DFB-Pokal|1971]] and [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in [[1972–73 DFB-Pokal|1973]]. The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in [[1972–73 Bundesliga|1973]] before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in [[1976–77 DFB-Pokal|1977]], beating [[Hertha BSC]] over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.

In 1977–78, FC Köln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the [[1977–78 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title, its third national title overall, and retaining the [[1977–78 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. This makes Köln one of only four clubs to have won [[Double (association football)#Germany|the double]] in [[Double (association football)#Bundesliga era|the Bundesliga era]].

Köln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in [[1979–80 DFB-Pokal|1980]], before winning the competition for a fourth time in [[1982–83 DFB-Pokal|1983]]. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5–3 on aggregate to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in [[1988–89 Bundesliga|1988–89]] and [[1989–90 Bundesliga|1989–90]], and another DFB-Pokal final loss in [[1990–91 DFB-Pokal|1991]], marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC Köln.

===21st century: ups and downs===
In recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The ''FC'' holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in [[2001–02 Bundesliga|2002]], the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11 and a half games) until [[Thomas Cichon]] found the back of the net again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2002/25/fckoeln-herthabsc/ | title = Das ersehnte Tor war zuwenig | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 2 March 2002 | accessdate = 10 December 2014}}</ref>

In the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC Köln was the most successful club in [[West Germany]] in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance fell, and in [[1997–98 Bundesliga|1998]], they were relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a "[[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]]", moving between the first and second divisions. They returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the [[2004–05 2. Bundesliga|2004–05 season]] as [[2. Bundesliga]] champions after having been relegated the [[2003–04 Bundesliga|season before]]. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine ''kicker'' as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.

This prediction came true when Köln lost to [[Hamburger SV]] 1–0 in the third to last match of [[2005–06 Bundesliga|the season]]. The club finished the season in second to last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was [[Lukas Podolski]] with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] after the end of the season. He also appeared with the [[Germany national football team|German national side]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

In late 2006, former coach [[Christoph Daum]] was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2. Bundesliga club and succeeded in leading the club back to the 1. Bundesliga in 2008. After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008–09, Daum left Köln for his former club [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football team)|Fenerbahçe]]. Köln's former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|2009–10 season]].

After a poor run of form in the [[2010–11 Bundesliga|2010–11 season]], recording only one win from their opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, Köln replaced coach [[Zvonimir Soldo]] with [[Frank Schaefer]]. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of Köln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] and recent [[F.C. Copenhagen]] coach, [[Ståle Solbakken]], replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Frank Schaefer and former Köln player [[Dirk Lottner]] replaced Solbakken.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2011/05/14/2486732/koln-confirm-stale-solbakken-as-new-coach-for-next-season/ |title=Köln confirm Stale Solbakken as new coach for next season |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref> However, the club was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in seventeenth place.

In the [[2012–13 2. Bundesliga|2012–13 season]], under new trainer [[Holger Stanislawski]], Köln finished in fifth place in the [[2. Bundesliga]], missing out on promotion back to the top division.

In the [[2013–14 2. Bundesliga|2013–14 season]], under the new trainer [[Peter Stöger]], FC Köln finished first in the [[2. Bundesliga]], and has been promoted back to the top division for the 2014–15 season.

FC Köln finished in twelfth place in the [[1. Bundesliga]] at the end of the [[2014–15 Bundesliga|2014–15 season]].

In the second succeeding season since the promotion the club finished under [[Peter Stöger]] on 9th  position in the [[2015–16 Bundesliga|2015–16 season]], the best club finish in the Bundesliga since the 1991/1992 season.

The team plays its home matches in the [[RheinEnergie Stadion|Sportpark Müngersdorf]] (official name: RheinEnergie Stadion), with a capacity of 50,000. <br>
The official name ''RheinEnergie Stadion'' comes from a contract with the local power supplier RheinEnergie AG that will last until 2018. <br>
However, most fans still call the stadium "Müngersdorfer Stadion", named after the suburb of Müngersdorf, where it is located. <br>
The average attendance in the 2015–2016 season was 48.676.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/bundesliga-2015-2016/1/ |title=Germany » Bundesliga 2015/2016 » Attendance » Home matches |website=worldfootball.net |accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref>
