The '''Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation''' (spelled as '''Twentieth Century-Fox''' with a hyphen used from its inception until 1985, stylized as '''20th Century Fox''' and also known as '''TCFFC''' or simply '''Fox''') is an American [[film studio]], distributor and one of the 6 [[major film studio|major American film studios]]. Located in the [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]] area of [[Los Angeles]], just west of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], the studio is currently owned by [[21st Century Fox]] and is formerly owned by [[News Corporation]].

20th Century Fox has distributed famous film series, including the first two ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogies (although [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] owns the rights), ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'', ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]'', ''[[Home Alone (franchise)|Home Alone]]'', ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum (film series)|Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Taken (film series)|Taken]]'', ''[[The Omen (film series)|The Omen]]'', ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (film series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]''. The studio is also credited for distributing [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', the highest and second highest grossing films respectively at the box-office not adjusted for inflation. Television series produced by Fox include ''[[the Simpsons]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[Modern Family]]'', ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'', and ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. Among the most famous actresses to come out of this studio were [[Shirley Temple]], who was 20th Century Fox's first film star, [[Alice Faye]], [[Betty Grable]], [[Gene Tierney]], [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Jayne Mansfield]]. The studio also contracted the first African-American cinema star, [[Dorothy Dandridge]].

20th Century Fox is a member of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].<ref name=MPAA>{{cite web|title=Motion Picture Association of America&nbsp;– About Us |url=http://www.mpaa.org/about |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref> In 2015, 20th Century Fox celebrated its 80th anniversary as a studio.

[[Twentieth Century Pictures]]' [[Joseph Schenck]] and [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] left [[United Artists]] over a stock dispute, and began merger talks with the management of financially struggling [[Fox Film]], under president Sidney Kent.<ref name="Cobbles">{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/zanuck-schenck.htm|title=The Formation of Twentieth Century-Fox|work={{noitalic|Cobbles}}|location=United States|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> [[Spyros Skouras]], then manager of the [[Fox West Coast Theaters]], helped make it happen (and later became president of the new company).<ref name="Cobbles"/>  Aside from the theater chain and a first-rate studio lot, Zanuck and Schenck felt there was not much else to Fox, which had been reeling since founder [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] lost control of the company in 1930. The studio's biggest star, [[Will Rogers]], died in a plane crash weeks after the merger. Its leading female star, [[Janet Gaynor]], was fading in popularity and promising leading men [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] and [[Spencer Tracy]] had been dropped because of heavy drinking.

At first, it was expected that the new company was originally to be called "Fox-20th Century", even though 20th Century was the senior partner in the merger. However, 20th Century brought more to the bargaining table besides Schenck and Zanuck; it was more profitable than Fox and had considerably more talent.  The new company, 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, began trading on May 31, 1935;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://secrethistoryoftheus.weebly.com/the-media.html|title=JEWS AND THE MEDIA|work={{noitalic|Secret History of the US}}|location=United States|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> the hyphen was dropped in 1985. Schenck became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, while Kent remained as President. Zanuck became Vice President in Charge of Production, replacing Fox's longtime production chief [[Winfield Sheehan]].

For many years, 20th Century Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915, the year Fox Film was founded.  For instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary.  However, in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding, even though most film historians agree it was founded in 1915.<ref name="NY Post">{{cite news|url=http://nypost.com/2010/02/10/is-fox-really-75-this-year-somewhere-the-fantastic-mr-william-fox-begs-to-differ|title=Is Fox really 75 this year? Somewhere, the fantastic Mr. (William) Fox begs to differ|author=New York Post Staff|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|date=February 10, 2010|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref>

The company's films retained the 20th Century Pictures searchlight logo on their opening credits as well as its opening fanfare, but with the name changed to 20th Century-Fox.

After the merger was completed, Zanuck quickly signed young actors who would carry Twentieth Century-Fox for years:{{sfn|Lev|2014|page=23}} [[Tyrone Power]], [[Linda Darnell]], [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Don Ameche]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Gene Tierney]], [[Sonja Henie]], and [[Betty Grable]]. Also on the Fox payroll he found two players who he built up into the studio's leading assets, [[Alice Faye]] and seven-year-old [[Shirley Temple]]. Favoring popular biographies and musicals, Zanuck built Fox back to profitability. Thanks to record attendance during World War II, Fox overtook [[RKO]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (Hollywood's biggest studio) to become the third most profitable film studio. While Zanuck went off for eighteen months' war service, junior partner [[William Goetz]] kept profits high by going for light entertainment. The studio's—indeed the industry's—biggest star was creamy blonde Betty Grable.

In 1942, Spyros Skouras succeeded Kent as president of the studio. Together with Zanuck, who returned in 1943, they intended to make Fox's output more serious-minded.{{sfn|Barkan|2001|page=349}} During the next few years, with pictures like ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', ''[[Wilson (1944 film)|Wilson]]'', ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'', ''[[The Snake Pit]]'', ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang]]'', and ''[[Pinky (film)|Pinky]]'', Zanuck established a reputation for provocative, adult films. Fox also specialized in adaptations of best-selling books such as [[Ben Ames Williams]]' ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945), starring Gene Tierney, which was the highest-grossing Fox film of the 1940s. Fox also produced film versions of Broadway musicals, including the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] films, beginning with the musical version of ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'', the only work that the famous team wrote especially for films, in 1945, and continuing years later with ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' in 1956, ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. They also made the 1958 film version of ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]''. Fox released [[B pictures]] made by producers [[Edward L. Alperson]] from the mid-1940s and [[Robert L. Lippert]] (Regal and later Associated Pictures Inc.) in the mid-1950s.

After the war, and with the advent of television, audiences slowly drifted away. Twentieth Century Fox held on to its theaters until a court-mandated "divorce"; they were spun off as Fox National Theaters in 1953.{{sfn|Lev|2013|page=162}} That year, with attendance at half the 1946 level, Twentieth Century Fox gambled on an unproven gimmick. Noting that the two film sensations of 1952 had been [[Cinerama]], which required three projectors to fill a giant curved screen, and "Natural Vision" [[3-D film|3D]], which got its effects of depth by requiring the use of polarized glasses, Fox mortgaged its studio to buy rights to a French anamorphic projection system which gave a slight illusion of depth without glasses. President [[Spyros Skouras]] struck a deal with the inventor [[Henri Chrétien]], leaving the other film studios empty-handed, and in 1953 introduced CinemaScope in the studio's ground-breaking feature film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahooschools.org/vnews/display.v/SEC/Community%7CWahoo's%20Famous%20Sons%3E%3EDarryl%20Zanuck|title=Zanuck Remembered as a Hollywood Powerhouse|work=[[Wahoo, Nebraska|Wahoo School District]]|date=March 1, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref>

The success of ''The Robe'' was so massive that in February 1953 Zanuck announced that henceforth all Fox pictures would be made in CinemaScope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northwestchicagofilmsociety.org/2012/07/16/moving-pictures-that-move-house-of-bamboo-in-cinemascope/|title=Moving Pictures That Move: House of Bamboo in CinemaScope|date=June 16, 2012|work={{noitalic|Northwest Chicago Film Society}}|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> To convince theater owners to install this new process, Fox agreed to help pay conversion costs (about $25,000 per screen); and to ensure enough product, Fox gave access to CinemaScope to any rival studio choosing to use it. Seeing the box-office for the first two CinemaScope features, ''The Robe'' and ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', Warner Bros., MGM, [[Universal Pictures]] (then known as [[Universal-International]]), [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] quickly adopted the process. In 1956 Fox engaged [[Robert Lippert]] to establish a subsidiary company, [[Regal Pictures]], later [[Associated Producers Incorporated]] to film [[B picture]]s in CinemaScope (but "branded" RegalScope).

CinemaScope brought a brief up-turn in attendance, but by 1956 the numbers again began to slide.{{sfn|Watson|2015|page=290}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/poetics_10cinemascope.pdf|page=290|title='The Modern Miracle You See Without Glasses' - CinemaScope: 1953 - 1954: 'Twentieth Century-Fox presents A CinemaScope Production': 1953 - 1954 (Films made in CinemaScope from 1953 to 1956)|work={{noitalic|David Bordwell}}|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> That year Darryl Zanuck announced his resignation as head of production. Zanuck moved to [[Paris]], setting up as an independent producer; he did not set foot in California again for twenty years.

===Production and financial problems===
Zanuck's successor, producer [[Buddy Adler]], died a year later.{{sfn|Harris|2011|page=1900}} President Spyros Skouras brought in a series of production executives, but none had Zanuck's success. By the early 1960s Fox was in trouble. A new version of ''Cleopatra'' had begun in 1959 with [[Joan Collins]] in the lead.<ref name="Kamp"/> As a publicity gimmick, producer [[Walter Wanger]] offered one million dollars to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] if she would star;<ref name="Kamp"/> she accepted, and costs for ''Cleopatra'' began to escalate, aggravated by [[Richard Burton]]'s on-set romance with Taylor, the surrounding media frenzy, and Skouras' selfish preferences and inexperienced micromanagement on the film's production. Not even his showmanship made up for his considerable lack of filmmaking in speeding up production on ''Cleopatra''.

Meanwhile, another remake—of the 1940 [[Cary Grant]] hit ''[[My Favorite Wife]]''— was rushed into production in an attempt to turn over a quick profit to help keep Fox afloat. The [[romantic comedy]] entitled ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' paired [[Marilyn Monroe]], Fox's most bankable star of the 1950s, with [[Dean Martin]], and director [[George Cukor]]. The troubled Monroe caused delays on a daily basis, and it quickly descended into a costly debacle. As ''Cleopatra''{{'}}s budget passed the ten-million-dollar mark, settling somewhere around $40 million, Fox sold its back lot (now the site of [[Century City]]) to Alcoa in 1961 to raise cash. After several weeks of script rewrites on the Monroe picture and very little progress, mostly due to the director George Cukor's slow and repetitive filming, in addition to Monroe's chronic sinusitus, Marilyn Monroe was fired from ''Something's Got to Give''<ref name="Kamp">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1998/03/elizabeth-taylor-199803|title=When Liz Met Dick|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=April 29, 2016|first=David|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|last=Kamp}}</ref> and two months later she was found dead.  According to Fox files she was rehired within weeks for a two-picture deal totaling one million dollars, $500K to finish ''Something's Got to Give'', plus a bonus at completion, and $500K for ''What a Way to Go''. Elizabeth Taylor's disruptive {{POV statement|date=March 2013}} reign on the ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' set continued unchallenged from 1960 into 1962, though three Fox executives went to [[Rome]] in June 1962 to fire her. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} They learned that director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] had filmed out of sequence and had only done interiors, so Fox was then forced to allow Taylor several more weeks of filming. In the meantime that summer of '62, Fox released nearly all of its contract stars, including Jayne Mansfield.{{sfn|Ferruccio|2010||page=117}}{{sfn|Strait|1992|page=86}}

With few pictures on the schedule, Skouras wanted to rush Zanuck's big-budget war epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'',<ref name="Kamp"/> a highly accurate account of the [[Normandy Landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944, with a huge international cast, into release as another source of quick cash. This offended Zanuck, still Fox's largest shareholder, for whom ''The Longest Day'' was a labor of love that he had dearly wanted to produce for years. After it became clear that ''Something's Got to Give'' would not be able to progress without Monroe in the lead (Martin had refused to work with anyone else), Skouras finally decided that something had to give and re-signed her. But days before filming was due to resume, [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|she was found dead]] at her Los Angeles home and the picture resumed filming as ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'', with [[Doris Day]] and [[James Garner]] in the leads. Released in 1963, the film was a hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisday.net/move-over-darling/|title=Move Over, Darling|work={{noitalic|Doris Day}}|location=United States|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> The unfinished scenes from ''Something's Got to Give'' were shelved for nearly 40 years. Rather than being rushed into release as if it were a B-picture, ''The Longest Day'' was lovingly and carefully produced under Zanuck's supervision. It was finally released at a length of three hours, and went on to be recognized as one of the great World War II films.

At the next board meeting, Zanuck spoke for eight hours, convincing directors that Skouras was mismanaging the company and that he was the only possible successor. Zanuck was installed as chairman, and then named his son [[Richard Zanuck]] as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3670633/The-Napoleon-of-Sunset-Boulevard.html|title=The Napoleon of Sunset Boulevard|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=January 20, 2008|last=Preston|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|first=John|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> This new management group seized ''Cleopatra'' and rushed it to completion, shut down the studio, laid off the entire staff to save money, axed the long-running [[Movietone News]]reel and made a series of cheap, popular pictures that restored Fox as a major studio. The biggest boost to the studio's fortunes came from the tremendous success of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/richard-d-zanuck-a-hollywood-legend-too-busy-to-look-back/|title=Richard D. Zanuck, a Hollywood legend too busy for nosta

Fox also had two big science-fiction hits in the 1960s: ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (which introduced [[Raquel Welch]] to film audiences) in 1966, and the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[Kim Hunter]], and [[Roddy McDowall]], in 1968. ''Fantastic Voyage'' was the last film made in [[CinemaScope]], which was ultimately replaced by Panavision lenses.

Zanuck stayed on as chairman until 1971, but there were several expensive flops in his last years, resulting in Fox posting losses from 1969 to 1971. Following his removal, and after an uncertain period, new management brought Fox back to health. Under president [[Gordon T. Stulberg]] and production head [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], Fox films connected with modern audiences. Stulberg used the profits to acquire resort properties, soft-drink bottlers, Australian theaters, and other properties in an attempt to diversify enough to offset the boom-or-bust cycle of picture-making.
 
Foreshadowing a pattern of film production still yet to come, in late 1973 Twentieth Century-Fox joined forces with Warner Bros. to co-produce ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardswatch.com/predictions/best-supporting-studio-warner-bros-pictures-track-record-in-the-best-supporting-actor-category/|location=United States|title=Best Supporting Studio: Warner Bros. Pictures’ Track Record in the Best Supporting Actor Category|last=Anderson|work={{noitalic|Awards Watch}}|date=September 28, 2013|first=Erik|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> an all-star action blockbuster from producer [[Irwin Allen]].  Both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios and announced that as Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be career suicide to have competing movies. And so the first joint venture studio deal was struck.  In hindsight whilst it may be common place now, back in the 1970s it was a risky, but revolutionary idea that paid off handsomely at both the domestic and international box offices around the world.

In 1977, Fox's success reached new heights and produced the most profitable film made up to that time, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Substantial financial gains were realized as a result of the film's unprecedented success: from a low of $6 in June 1976, stock prices more than quadrupled to almost $27 after ''Star Wars''' release; 1976 revenues of $195 million rose to $301 million in 1977.{{sfn|Solomon|2002|pages=19–20}}

===Marvin Davis and Rupert Murdoch===

[[Image:Foxplazafromolympicblvd.jpg|thumb|

With financial stability came new owners, when Fox was sold for more than $700 million in 1981 to investors [[Marc Rich]] and [[Marvin Davis]]. Fox's assets included [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]], the [[Aspen Skiing Company]], and a [[Century City, Los Angeles, California|Century City]] property upon which Davis built and twice sold [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]].

By 1985 Rich was a fugitive from U.S. justice, and Davis bought out his interest in Fox for $116 million.{{sfn|Wolff|2010|page=167}} Davis sold this interest to [[Rupert Murdoch]] for $250 million in March 1984. Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase [[John Kluge]]'s Metromedia television stations.{{sfn|Wolff|2010|page=167}} Murdoch went alone and bought the stations, and later bought out Davis' remaining stake in Fox for $325 million.{{sfn|Wolff|2010|page=167}}

To gain FCC approval of Fox's purchase of [[Metromedia]]'s television holdings, once the stations of the old [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network, Murdoch had to become a U.S. citizen. He did so in 1985, and in 1986 the new [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] took to the air. Over the next 20-odd years, the network and owned-stations group expanded to become extremely profitable for News Corp.

Since January 2000, this company has been the international distributor for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] releases. In the 1980s, Fox—through a joint venture with [[CBS]], called [[CBS/Fox Video]]—had distributed certain UA films on video, thus UA has come full circle by switching to Fox for video distribution. Fox also makes money distributing films for small independent film companies.

In 2008, Fox announced an Asian subsidiary, Fox STAR Studios, a joint venture with [[STAR TV]], also owned by News Corporation. It was reported that Fox STAR would start by producing films for the [[Bollywood]] market, then expand to several Asian markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2008/09/fox-sets-asian.html|title=Fox sets Asian movie venture|accessdate=April 29, 2016|author=Los Angeles Times Staff|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

In August 2012, 20th Century Fox signed a five-year deal with [[DreamWorks Animation]] to distribute in domestic and international markets. However, the deal did not include the distribution rights of previously released films which DreamWorks Animation acquired from [[Paramount Pictures]] later in 2014.<ref name=VarietyQ22014Earnings>{{cite journal|last1=Chney|first1=Alexandra|title=DreamWorks Animation Q2 Earnings Fall Short of Estimates, SEC Investigation Revealed|url=http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/dreamworks-animation-q2-earnings-fall-short-of-estimates-1201271262/|accessdate=July 30, 2014|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 2012, Rupert Murdoch announced that News Corp. would be split into two publishing and media-oriented companies; a [[News Corp|new News Corporation]], and [[21st Century Fox]], which houses Fox Entertainment Group and 20th Century Fox. Murdoch considered the name of the new company a way to maintain the 20th Century Fox's heritage as the group advances into the future.<ref name=verge-21stlogo>{{cite web|last=Welch|first=Chris|title=21st Century Fox logo unveiled ahead of News Corp split|url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/9/4316444/21st-century-fox-logo-revealed-by-rupert-murdoch|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}</ref><ref name=GuardianLogo>{{cite web|last=Rushe|first=Dominic|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jun/18/rupert-murdoch-split-empire-news-corp?CMP=twt_fd|title=Rupert Murdoch splits empire but keeps faith in tomorrow's newspapers|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>

As of 2016, in Australia, 20th Century Fox has an expanded movie deal to replay movie and television content from television broadcasters, [[Network Ten]], [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]] and [[One (Australian TV channel)|One]] occasionally also on [[Nine Network]] & [[9Gem]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In the [[Netherlands]] and in the [[Philippines]], 20th Century Fox films are distributed by fellow rival [[Warner Bros]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Television==
{{Main|20th Century Fox Television|20th Television|Fox 21 Television Studios}}
[[20th Television]] is Fox's television [[Television syndication|syndication]] division. [[20th Century Fox Television]] is the studio's television production division.

During the mid-1950s features were released to television in the hope that they would broaden sponsorship and help distribution of network programs. Blocks of one-hour programming of feature films to national sponsors on 128 stations was organized by Twentieth Century Fox and National Telefilm Associates. Twentieth Century Fox received 50 percent interest in NTA Film network after it sold its library to National Telefilm Associates. This gave 90 minutes of cleared time a week and syndicated feature films to 110 non-interconnected stations for sale to national sponsors.<ref name=Boddy>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fifties_Television.html?id=sWjhCESKy4AC|last=Boddy|first=William|year=1990|title=Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics|location=[[Urbana, Illinois]]|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}</ref>

==Music==
{{Main|20th Century Records|Fox Music}}

Between 1933 and 1937, a custom record label called ''Fox Movietone'' was produced starting at F-100 and running through F-136.  It featured songs from Fox movies, first using material recorded and issued on [[Victor Records|Victor]]'s [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label and halfway through switched to material recorded and issued on [[American Record Corporation|ARC]]'s dime store labels (Melotone, Perfect, etc.).  These scarce records were sold only at Fox Theaters.

[[Fox Music]] has been Fox's music arm since 2000. It encompasses music publishing and licensing businesses, dealing primarily with Fox Entertainment Group television and film soundtracks.

Prior to Fox Music, 20th Century Records was its music arm from 1958 to 1982.

==Radio==
The ''Twentieth Century Fox Presents'' radio series<ref name=RUSC>{{cite web|url=http://www.rusc.com/old-time-radio/20th-Century-Fox-Presents.aspx?s=809|title=20th Century Fox Presents|work={{noitalic|RUSC}}|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> were broadcast between 1936 and 1942. More often than not, the shows were a radio preview featuring a medley of the songs and soundtracks from the latest movie being released into the theaters, much like the modern day movie trailers we now see on TV, to encourage folks to head down to their nearest Picture House.

The radio shows featured the original stars, with the announcer narrating a lead up that encapsulated the performance.

==Motion picture film processing==
From its earliest ventures into movie production, Fox Film Corporation operated its own processing laboratories.  The original lab was located in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] along with the studios.  A lab was included with the new studio built in Los Angeles in 1916.<ref>Fox Folks Vol. I, No. 4, August, 1922.</ref> Headed by [[Alan E. Freedman]], the Fort Lee lab was moved into the new Fox Studios building in Manhattan in 1919.<ref>Fox Folks Vol. I, No. 4, August, 1922.  Also, Vol. III, No. 7, July, 1924, p. 12 and back outside cover, and Vol. III, No. 8, August, 1924, p. 8.</ref>  In 1932, Freedman bought the labs from Fox for $2,000,000 to bolster what at that time was a failing Fox liquidity.<ref>Image, DeLuxe Laboratories, Inc. check 101 to Fox Film Corporation for $2,000,000.</ref><ref name=FilmDaily>{{cite news|title=Freedman Group Buys Fox Film Laboratories|work=[[Film Daily]]|location=United States|date=April 3, 1932|accessdate=April 29, 2016|page=1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdailyvolume55859newy#page/799/mode/1up}}</ref> He renamed the operation "DeLuxe Laboratories" which much later became [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|DeLuxe Entertainment Services Group]].  In the 1940s Freedman sold the labs back to what was then 20th Century Fox and remained as president into the 1960s.  Under Freedman's leadership, DeLuxe added two more labs in Chicago and Toronto and processed film from studios other than Fox.

==Logo and fanfare==
[[File:Screenshot 20th Century Fox Logo in 1975.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|The 20th Century Fox logo used from 1953 to 1987, 1991, created for the new [[CinemaScope]] process with the slanted "0".]]

The fanfare was originally composed in 1933 by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], who became head of Twentieth Century-Fox's music department from 1940 until the 1960s. It was re-recorded in 1935 when 20th Century Fox was officially established.

The [[Art Deco]] 20th Century Fox logo, designed by special effects animator and matte painting artist [[Emil Kosa, Jr.]], originated as the 20th Century Pictures logo, with the name "Fox" substituted for "Pictures, Inc." in 1935. The logo was originally created as [[matte painting|a painting on several layers of glass]] and animated frame-by-frame. Over the years the logo was modified several times.<ref name=famouslogos>{{cite web|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/20th-century-fox-logo/|title=20th Century Fox Logo|work={{noitalic|Famous Logos}}|location=United States|date=May 8, 2011|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> Kosa's last major work for Fox was the matte painting of the Statue of Liberty in ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', shortly before his death.

[[File:Logo 20th century fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|20th Century Fox's CGI logo used from 1994 to 2010; 2013; still used on 20th Century Fox websites.]]

In 1953, Rocky Longo, an artist at [[Pacific Title and Art|Pacific Title]], was hired to recreate the original design for the new CinemaScope process, while Alfred Newman composed the fanfare's new CinemaScope extension. In order to give the design the required "width", Longo tilted the "0" in ''20th''. The new version of the fanfare was first used on the film ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', released in the same year. ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'', the first film released in CinemaScope, used the sound of a choir singing over the logo, instead of the regular fanfare. In 1981, Longo repainted the logo design once again, and straightened the "0". The Fox fanfare was re-orchestrated in 1981, as Longo's revised logo was being introduced.

By the 1970s the Fox fanfare was being used in films sporadically. [[George Lucas]] enjoyed the Alfred Newman music so much that he insisted it be used for ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), which features the CinemaScope version (but the variation conducted by Lionel Newman, as the Alfred Newman original version had been misfiled). Composer [[John Williams]] composed the ''Star Wars'' main theme in the same key ([[B-flat major|B{{flat}} major]]) as the Fox fanfare, serving as an extension to Newman's score. In 1980, Williams conducted a new version of the extended fanfare for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Williams's recording of the Fox fanfare has been used in every ''[[Star Wars]]'' film until ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' in 2005. Since the introduction of the CGI Fox logo in the early to mid-1990s, the series used the static angle version of the new logo, to allow for the animated [[Lucasfilm]] logo to appear during the extension.

In 1994, after a few failed attempts (which even included trying to film the familiar monument as an actual three-dimensional model), Fox in-house television producer [[Kevin Burns]] was hired to produce a new logo for the company—this time using the new process of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). With the help of graphics producer Steve Soffer and his company Studio Productions (which had recently given face-lifts to the Paramount and Universal logos), Burns directed that the new logo contain more detail and animation, so that the longer (21 second) Fox fanfare with the "CinemaScope extension" could be used as the underscore. This required a virtual Los Angeles cityscape to be designed around the monument. In the background can be seen the [[Hollywood sign]], which would give the monument an actual location (approximating Fox's actual address in Century City). One final touch was the addition of store-front signs—each one bearing the name of Fox executives who were at the studio at the time. One of the signs reads, "Murdoch's Department Store"; another says "[[Peter Chernin|Chernin]]'s"  a third reads: "Burns Tri-City Alarm" (an homage to Burns's late father who owned a burglar and fire alarm company in Upstate New York) a fourth reads: "Steve's Place" a fifth reads: "llinidi's" . The 1994 CGI logo was also the first time that Twentieth Century Fox was recognized as "A News Corporation Company" in the logo.

As the CGI logo was being prepared to premiere at the beginning of ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), Burns asked composer [[Bruce Broughton]] for a new version of the familiar fanfare. In 1997 Alfred's son, composer [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]], recorded the new version of the fanfare to reopen the Newman Scoring Stage originally known as Fox Scoring Stage and debuted in ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997). This rendition is still in use as of 1998 and hasn't been updated for the 21st century.

In 2009, a newly updated CGI logo, done by [[Blue Sky Studios]], debuted in the film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. A 75th Anniversary version of this new logo was used to coincide with 20th Century Fox's 75th anniversary; it made its official debut with ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'', and last appeared in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name="NY Post"/>

As [[television]] grew as a medium, the practice of placing [[production logo]]s at the end of programs became commonplace. For Fox's television arm, a truncated version of the Newman fanfare has been used with a brief shot of the Fox logo. Syndicated programs would overlay "Television" over "Century" in an animation, resulting in the logo reading "20th Television Fox". Today, CGI logos are used, with 20th Century Fox Television primarily for [[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox network]] programming, and 20th Television for other programming (such as cable and syndication).

Parodies of the fanfare have appeared at the start of the films ''[[Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines]]'' (played by a small band, imitating the silent era of films), ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (cars drive around the logo and knock out the searchlights), ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'' (rap version of the fanfare), ''[[Alien 3]]'' (fanfare slows down into an eerie sound), ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' (thunderstorm on the set), ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' (where the searchlights go out as a result of a power outage), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (featuring a silent-movie piano version of the fanfare), ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' ([[Ralph Wiggum]] "sings along" with the fanfare; in trailers and commercials, the "0" in the tower is replaced by a pink, half-bitten doughnut of the type [[Homer Simpsons|Homer]] eats), ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' (with snow and volcanoes covering the logo, but the regular 20th Century Fox logo was shown on the film's DVD and Blu-ray releases instead, but is shown on the Blu-ray 3D and TrioScopics 3D DVD releases), ''[[Rio 2]]'' (Samba version of the fanfare), ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]'' (played by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] on his toy piano) and ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (where the logo, alongside its [[DreamWorks]] counterpart, appears immersed in water, similar to the film's "precog" characters). The fanfare was also used within ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'', as the theme of Lush Budged Productions, opening [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s fantasy of her marriage to [[Robert Mitchum]]. Variations have also been used by various other Fox divisions and affiliated television stations, including [[WTVT]] in Tampa, FL, and the now-defunct [[Fox Kids Network]].

In ''[[Silent Movie]]'', the logo is shown on a billboard, past which [[Mel Brooks]] drives. In ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', it is snowing on the logo during the opening credits. In the 1994 production of ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and later international releases of the 1982 production of ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' the logo is shifted to the left, same thing with ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' in which it is on a starry background when the byline fades in. In the first three ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', the "X" in "Fox" glows as the scene fades out, same thing with the 2015 production of ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' in which the "F" in "Fox" glows as the scene fades out. In trailers for ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', the logo appears chrome to match Wolverine's claws. In ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', the logo appears on a stage behind a red curtain with a conductor directing an orchestra playing the fanfare. In the DVD menu for [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'']], the picture morphs into a negative image of the logo&nbsp;– as if perceived by the main character's radar sense. In the 2003 production of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', the logo appears as a huge unlit monument dominating the nighttime London skyline. In ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', the logo is tinted in dark yellow-ochre. In the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' films, the logo transforms into a paper sheet drawing. In ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', the logo is a shade of steely blue, rather than the usual color scheme. In ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'', the logo is dark and once it finishes its animation, it pans up to the night sky. In trailers and TV spots for ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]'', the logo takes place in a graveyard, the "0" in "20th" is replaced by a skull, the searchlight is replaced by two candles and much more.

{{Listen|filename=20th Century FOX fanfare.ogg|title=20th Century Fox Fanfare|description=The fanfare from the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] [[Revenge of the Sith]], plus the soundtracks of the [[1980 in film|1980 film]] ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', conducted by [[John Williams]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}

At the end of Fox's ''[[Futurama]]'', set in the 30th and 31st centuries, the logo is shown with the words "30th Century Fox Television".

As a surprise twist, the opening fanfare for ''[[Alien 3|Alien<sup>3</sup>]]'' has the music freeze on the penultimate melody tone (an [[E-flat minor]] chord), and then adds wailing [[French horns]] and [[bending]] strings, before continuing with a crash into the opening titles, thus setting the dark mood for the film.

Also on ''The Simpsons'' [[The Simpsons (season 10)|Season 10]] DVD, each disc's opening shows [[Bart Simpson]] running around the logo (after tagging it with "El Barto"), while being chased by the [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Squeaky-Voiced Teen|squeaky-voiced teenager]].

[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], [[Foxstar Productions]], and [[Fox Studios Australia]] are just a few of the other corporate entities that have used variations based on the original logo's design. [[21st Century Fox]], the corporate successor to News Corporation, uses a logo incorporating a minimalist representation of the searchlights.<ref name=verge-21stlogo/>
