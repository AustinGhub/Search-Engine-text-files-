{{2002 Winter Olympics}}
The '''2002 Winter Olympics''', officially the '''XIX Olympic Winter Games''' (French: Les ''XIXes Jeux olympiques d'hiver'') and commonly known as '''Salt Lake 2002''', were a winter [[multi-sport event]] that was celebrated in February 2002 in and around [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], United States. Approximately 2,400 athletes from 78 nations participated in 78 events in fifteen disciplines, held throughout 165 sporting sessions. The 2002 Winter Olympics and the [[2002 Paralympic Winter Games|2002 Paralympic Games]] were both organized by the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] (SLOC).<ref name="SLOC_Official_Report_p35">{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=35 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Utah became the fifth state in the United States to host the Olympic Games, and the 2002 Winter Olympics are the most recent games to be held in the United States.

The [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening ceremony]] was held on February 8, 2002, and sporting competitions were held up until the closing ceremony on February 24, 2002.<ref name="SLOC_Official_Report_p35"/>Production for both ceremonies was designed by [[Seven Nielsen]], and music for both ceremonies was directed by [[Mark Watters]].<ref name="Air-Edel_1">{{cite web|title=Air Edel &#124; Composers &#124; MARK WATTERS|url=http://www.air-edel.co.uk/representation/composers/18/mark-watters/|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> Salt Lake City became the most populous area ever to have hosted the Winter Olympics, although the two subsequent host cities' populations were larger.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metropop/table06.csv Salt Lake population figures] by the [[United States Census]]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}</ref> Following a trend, the 2002 Olympic Winter Games were also larger than all prior Winter Games, with 10 more events than the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], Japan;<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=36 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> this became a trend with more and more events held in subsequent Games.

The Salt Lake Games faced a [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bribery scandal]] and some local opposition during the bid, as well as some sporting and refereeing controversies during the competitions. Nevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, this was one of the most successful [[Winter Olympiad]]s in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over 2&nbsp;billion viewers watched more than 13&nbsp;billion viewer-hours.<ref name="Marketing_Matters_6_2002">{{cite book |title=Marketing Matters |last=[[International Olympic Committee]] |year=2002 |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_456.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of [[USD|$]]40&nbsp;million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues.<ref name="Marketing_Matters_6_2002"/> U.S. Federal subsidies amounted to $1.3 billion.<ref name="GAO">[http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa092400b.htm 2002 Olympics to Cost US Taxpayers $1.3 Billion] (accessed October 22, 2012)</ref>

Salt Lake City was chosen over Québec City, Canada, Sion, Switzerland, and Östersund, Sweden, on June 16, 1995, at the 104th [[IOC Session]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.<ref>[http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html IOC Vote History]</ref> Salt Lake City had previously come in second during the bids for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], awarded to [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], Japan, and had offered to be the provisional host of the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] when the original host, [[Denver, Colorado]], withdrew. The 1976 Winter Olympics were ultimately awarded to [[Innsbruck]], Austria.

[[File:2002 Winter Olympics flame.jpg|thumb|Olympic flame being lit by the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980 US Olympic Hockey Team]] at [[Rice-Eccles Stadium|Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium]] during the opening ceremonies.]]

[[File:US Navy 020208-N-3995K-002 2002 Olympics - WTC Flag.jpg|thumb|Members of the United States Olympic team hold the American flag that flew over the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, at [[Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium]].]]
* The opening ceremonies included [[Grammy Award]]-winning artist [[LeAnn Rimes]] singing "Light the Fire Within," the official song of the 2002 Olympics.
* The Grammy Award-winning [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] performed the "[[Star-Spangled Banner]]", national anthem of the United States, for the opening ceremonies.
* [[John Williams]] composed a five-minute work for orchestra and chorus, "[[Call of the Champions]]", that served as the official theme of the 2002 Winter Olympics, his first for a Winter Olympiad. It was performed by the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra]] and featured the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] and the [[Madeleine Choir School]] singing the official motto of the Olympic Games "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger). The premiere of the work at the opening ceremonies also corresponded with John Williams's 70th birthday. The work is featured on the CD ''American Journey'', and also on the Choir's recording ''Spirit of America''.
* There were also signs of remembrance of [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], being the first Olympics since then. They included the flag that flew at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer [[Daniel Rodríguez (tenor)|Daniel Rodriguez]] singing "[[God Bless America]]", and honor guards of NYPD and [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] members.
* Along with the flag that flew at the World Trade Center site, the [[Challenger flag]] was also carried into the stadium.
* The opening segment of the opening ceremony celebrated all previous hosts of the Olympic Winter Games.
* The Olympic Flame was lit by the members of the Gold Medal-winning US Hockey Team of the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, NY]], which was the previous time the Winter Olympics were in the US. (See picture at right)
* These Olympics marked the first time a [[President of the United States]] opened an Olympic Winter Games held in the United States, although previous Presidents [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Richard Nixon]] had opened the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] and the [[1960 Winter Olympics]] in their roles as [[Governor of New York]] and [[Vice President of the United States]], respectively.
* These were the first Games to be presided over by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]].
* Competition highlights included biathlete [[Ole Einar Bjørndalen]] of Norway, winning gold in all four men's events (10 k, 12.5 k, 20 k, 4 x 7.5 relay), [[Nordic combined]] athlete [[Samppa Lajunen]] of Finland winning three gold medals, [[Simon Ammann]] of Switzerland taking the double in ski jumping. In alpine skiing, [[Janica Kostelić]] won three golds and a silver (the first Winter Olympic medals ever for an athlete from Croatia and the first three-gold performance by a female), while [[Kjetil André Aamodt]] of Norway earned his second and third career golds, setting up both athletes to beat the sport's record with their fourth golds earned at the next [[Alpine skiing at the 2006 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics near Turin]] (Aamodt also set the overall medal record in the sport with 8).
* [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] returned as a medal sport in the 2002 Games for the first time since 1948.
* Ireland reached its best ever position and came close to winning its first winter medal when [[Clifton Wrottesley]] (Clifton Hugh Lancelot de Verdon Wrottesley, 6th Baron Wrottesley) finished fourth in the men's skeleton event.
* The Women's Bobsled Event had its debut at the 2002 Games after several years of World Cup competition.
* A feature of these Games was the emergence of the extreme sports, such as snowboarding, moguls and aerials, which appeared in previous Olympic Winter Games but have captured greater public attention in recent years.
* The United States completed a remarkable sweep of the podium in men's halfpipe [[snowboarding]], with Americans [[Ross Powers]], [[Danny Kass]], and [[Jarret Thomas]] all winning medals.
* American [[Sarah Hughes]] won the gold medal in figure skating. American and heavy favorite [[Michelle Kwan]] fell during her long program and received the bronze medal.
* China won its first and second Winter Olympic gold medals, both by women's short-track speed skater [[Yang Yang (A)]].
* One of the most memorable stories of the event occurred at the men's short track. Australian skater [[Steven Bradbury (speed skater)|Steven Bradbury]], a competitor who had won a bronze in [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] as part of a relay team but well off the pace of the medal favourites, cruised off the pace in his semifinal only to see three of his competitors crash into each other, allowing him to finish second and go through to the final. Bradbury was again well off the pace, but lightning struck again and all four other competitors crashed out in the final turn, leaving a jubilant Bradbury to take the most unlikely of gold medals, the first for Australia—or any other country of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]—in the Olympic Winter Games.
* Australia winning their second gold medal, courtesy of [[Alisa Camplin]] in Women's Aerials, the first ever Winter Games gold won by a woman from the Southern Hemisphere.
* The Canadian men's [[ice hockey]] team defeated the American team 5–2 to claim the gold medal, ending [[Lucky loonie|50 years without the hockey gold]]. The Canadian women's team also defeated the American team 3–2 after losing to them at the [[Ice Hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]].
* The closing ceremonies marked the final live performance of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] with its lineup of [[Paul Stanley|Stanley]]/[[Gene Simmons|Simmons]]/[[Ace Frehley|Frehley]]/[[Eric Singer|Singer]]. They performed "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]". Other artists performing at the 2002 ceremonies were [[Willie Nelson]], [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Sting (singer)|Sting]], [[Yo Yo Ma]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Dianne Reeves]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Dorothy Hamill]], [[Dave Matthews Band]], [['N Sync]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[The Dixie Chicks]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Charlotte Church]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] and, during the presentation of Turin, [[Irene Grandi]], and [[Elisa (Italian singer)|Elisa]].
* There was a Canadian dollar underneath the ice in support of the Canadian men's team, supposedly placed there at the request of [[Wayne Gretzky]], who knew the man responsible for ice upkeep.
* Team Belarus's [[Vladimir Kopat]] scored a [[game winning goal]] from center ice against Team Sweden in the quarter finals, getting Belarus to their best place in international hockey so far.
* The games were formally closed by International Olympic Committee President [[Jacques Rogge]] departing from former IOC President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]]'s tradition of declaring each games "best ever". Rogge's began a tradition of assigning each games their own identity in his comments calling the 2002 Salt Lake Games "flawless".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-features/news/newsid=453954.html|title='Excellent and friendly Games' come to a close |last=Abrahamson|first=Alan |date=March 1, 2010|publisher=NBC|accessdate=March 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100310010809/http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-features/news/newsid=453954.html| archivedate= March 10, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Prior to the ceremony, the turf inside the stadium was removed and a giant, abstract shaped ice rink, designed by Seven Nielsen, was installed, covering a large part of the stadium floor. Performers would later perform on ice skates, rather than shoes.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

An American flag rescued from the World Trade Center Site on September 11 was carried into the stadium by an honor guard of American athletes and was carried in by firefighters and police officers. The [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]], clad in white sweaters, performed [[The Star Spangled Banner]], the US national anthem, as the flag was raised. The parade of the 2,300 athletes was led by the Child of Light and began traditionally with [[Greece]] and ending with the host nation, the United States of America. As the artistic section kicked off, the five native Utah [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes arrived together on horseback and performed several traditional "Welcome" stomp dances. The [[Dixie Chicks]] also performed.

The beauty of the Utah landscape was showcased as huge puppets of native Utah animals, including a 15-foot-long [[bison]] and the [[American bald eagle]] (the national bird and animal of the U.S.), entered the stadium, as well as dancing pioneer settlers as two trains came together on, symbolizing the US railroad industry which was beneficial to Utah's economy beginning in the 1860s, as well as economically linking the Western U.S. and the Eastern U.S. At the end of their performance, the performers unfurled a giant quilt that covered the entire stadium floor with the 2002 Winter Olympics logo in the center.<ref name=ceremonies />  Two figure skaters, Olympians Kristi Yamaguchi and Scott Hamilton performed on the over-sized ice rink as "Light the Fire Within," the 2002 Winter Olympic's theme song was sung by LeAnn Rimes.<ref name="ceremonies">{{cite web |url= http://saltlake2002legacy.com/ceremonies/  |title=CEREMONIES Salt Lake 2002 |author=N/A |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |archiveurl = http://saltlake2002legacy.com/ceremonies/ |archivedate = December 26, 2012}}</ref>

After speeches by [[Jacques Rogge]], President over the IOC and [[Mitt Romney]], the CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, the Olympic flame, which had traveled {{convert|13500|mi|km}} was carried into the stadium by gold medalists [[Dorothy Hamill]] and [[Dick Button]]. They passed the flame to other pairs U.S. Olympic heroes, who either ran or skated their short relay. Gold medalists in Nagano 1998 [[Picabo Street]] and [[Cammi Granato]] carried the flame up the steps to the towering cauldron where they were met by [[Mike Eruzione]], captain of the miracle on ice hockey team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1980. Eruzione summoned the other members of the team, who together lit the Olympic cauldron.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT28SNK1YEk Salt Lake City Flame Lighting]. YouTube (February 19, 2011). Retrieved on August 16, 2013.</ref>  The Opening Ceremony would win seven [[Emmy Awards]].<ref name=ceremonies />

While there was a lot of [[Reactions to the September 11 attacks|international sympathy]] for the US in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], there were complaints that the Games were being conducted in an overtly patriotic manner. President Bush received some criticism for departing from the Olympic charter by extending the declaration to open the Games, saying “On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation” before the traditional formula, “I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City”.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/feb/15/usa.olympicgames/print|title=Chariots of ire: is US jingoism tarnishing the Olympic ideal?|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=February 15, 2002|accessdate=September 2, 2008  | first=Duncan | last=MacKay}}</ref> In addition, the President opened the Games standing among the US athletes, while previous heads of state opened the Games from an official box. [[NBC]]'s [[Bob Costas]] applauded the move during the network's coverage of the Opening Ceremony.

The official box was occupied by the President's Olympic delegation:
* [[Dorothy Koch]], the President's sister
* [[Colin Powell]], [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]

==2002 Olympic Symbols==

===Olympic Emblem===
[[File:020222-N-LW438-002.JPEG|thumb|The 2002 Olympic emblem on the bobsled track at the [[Utah Olympic Park]].]]
[[File:2002SLC proof gold.JPG|thumb|2002 Olympic Winter Games $5 coin created by the [[US Mint]].]]
[[File:Boeing 777-200.jpg|thumb|right|[[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]'s [[Boeing 777]]-200 in [[livery]] commemorating the Games.]]
[[File:Salt Lake 2002 torch cu.jpg|thumb|150px|Detail of the 2002 Winter Games Olympic Torch.]]
The 2002 Olympic emblem is a snowflake, which consisted of three separate sections. The yellow top section symbolizes the Olympic Flame, and represents the athletes' courage. The orange center section symbolizes the ancient [[Navajo weaving|weaving styles]] of Utah's Native Americans, and represents the region's culture. The blue/purple bottom section symbolizes a snow-capped mountain, and represents the contrast of Utah's mountain and desert areas. The orange/yellow colors above the blue/purple bottom section also gave the appearance of a sun rising from behind a mountain.

===Theme colors===
An official palette of colors, which ranged from cool blues to warm reds and oranges, was created for the Salt Lake 2002 games. The palette became part of the official design theme named ''Land of Contrast – Fire and Ice'', with the blues representing the cooler, snowy, [[Wasatch Front|mountainous regions]] of Northern Utah, and the oranges and red representing the warmer, rugged, [[Colorado Plateau|red-rock areas]] of Southern Utah.<ref name="SLOC_Official_Report_designs">{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=206 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Pictograms===
As with all Olympic games, pictograms, which easily identified the venues, sports, and services for spectators without using a written language, were specifically designed for the Salt Lake 2002 games. The pictograms for these games mimicked the designs of [[Branding iron|branding-irons]] found in the western United States, and used the ''Fire and Ice'' theme colors of the Salt Lake 2002 Games. The line thickness and 30-degree angles found in the pictograms mirror those found in the snowflake emblem.<ref name="SLOC_Official_Report_designs"/>

[[File:Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Mascots.svg|right|thumb|Powder, Copper and Coal<br />2002 Olympic Mascots]]

===The mascots===
{{Main|Powder, Copper and Coal}}
The mascots represent three of the indigenous animals of the [[Western United States]], and are named after natural resources which have long been important to Utah's economy, survival, and culture. All three animals are major characters in the legends of local Native Americans, and each mascot wears a charm around its neck with an original [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Anasazi]] or [[Fremont culture|Fremont]]-style [[petroglyph]].
* '''Powder''' – A [[Snowshoe Hare]], represents the Native American legend when the sun was too close to the earth and was burning it. The hare ran to the top of a mountain, and shot her arrow into the sun. This caused it to drop lower in the sky, cooling the earth.
* '''Copper''' – A [[Coyote]], represents the Native American legend when the earth froze and turned dark, the coyote climbed to the highest mountaintop and stole a flame from the fire people. He returned and brought warmth and light to the people.
* '''Coal''' – An [[American black bear]], represents the Native American legend of hunters who were never able to kill the mighty bear. Today the sons of these hunters still chase the bear across the night sky, as [[constellation]]s.

===The Olympic Torch and relay===

{{Main|2002 Winter Olympics torch relay}}

The 2002 Olympic Torch is modeled after an icicle, with a slight curve to represent speed and fluidity. The Torch measures {{convert|33|in|cm}} long, {{convert|3|in|cm}} wide at the top, {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} at the bottom, and was designed by Axiom Design of Salt Lake City.<ref name="SLOC_torch_info">{{cite web |url=http://www.saltlake2002.com/sloc/beyond_sport/torch_relay/tr_index.html  |title=Olympic Torch Relay |author=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011024135215/http://www.saltlake2002.com/sloc/beyond_sport/torch_relay/tr_index.html |archivedate = October 24, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic Torch Design |newspaper=KSL-TV |date=February 21, 2001 |url=http://2002.ksl.com/news-3320i.php?p=1 |accessdate=October 27, 2010}}</ref> It was created with three sections, each with its own meaning and representation.<ref name="SLOC_torch_info"/>

The [[2002 Winter Olympics torch relay|torch relay]] was a 65-day run, from December 4, 2001 to February 8, 2002, which carried the Olympic flame through 46 of the 50 states in the United States.<ref name="SLOC_Official_Report_route_plan">{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=246 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 25, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105050321/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= November 5, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The torch covered {{convert|13500|mi|km}}, passed through 300 communities, and was carried by 12,012 Torchbearers.<ref name="SLOC_Official_Report_route_plan"/>

===The Olympic Cauldron===
The Olympic Cauldron was designed with the official motto ''Light the Fire Within'' and the ''Fire and Ice'' theme in mind. It was designed to look like an [[icicle]], and was made of glass which allowed the fire to be seen burning within. The actual glass cauldron stands atop a twisting glass and steel support, is {{convert|12|ft|m}} high, and the flame within burns at {{convert|900|F|C|1}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cauldron creation detailed in book |author=Lisa Riley Roche |newspaper=Deseret News |date=January 31, 2004 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/590040014/Cauldron-creation-detailed-in-book.html |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref> Together with its support the cauldron stands {{convert|117|ft|m}} tall and was made of 738 individual pieces of glass. Small jets send water down the glass sides of the cauldron, both to keep the glass and metal cooled (so they would not crack or melt), and to give the effect of melting ice.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee |year=2002 |isbn=0-9717961-0-6 |page=207 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf| archivedate= October 8, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The cauldron was designed by [[WET Design]] of Los Angeles, its frame built by [[Arrow Dynamics]] of [[Clearfield, Utah]], and its glass pieces created by Western Glass of [[Ogden, Utah]]. The cauldron's cost was 2 million dollars, and it was unveiled to the public during its original install at Rice-Eccles Stadium (2002 Olympic Stadium) on January 8, 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=Caldron Unveiled |author=John Daley |newspaper=KSL-TV |date=January 8, 2002 |url=http://2002.ksl.com/news-3656i.php?p=1 |accessdate=November 3, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100927204416/http://2002.ksl.com/news-3656i.php?p=1| archivedate= September 27, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Following the completion of the 2002 Winter Olympics the cauldron was installed at the permanent [[Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park]], next the 2002 Olympic Stadium in Salt Lake City.

A second Olympic cauldron burned at the Awards Plaza in downtown Salt Lake City during the games. It was known as the ''Hero's Cauldron'' and was in the backdrop of every awards ceremony. This was the first time two cauldrons were used during the same Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite news |title= Two Cauldrons Burning |url=http://2002.ksl.com/news-4796i.php |newspaper=KSL-TV |date=February 9, 2002 |accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref>

==Concerns and controversies==

=== Bribery to bring the games to Salt Lake City ===
{{Main|2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal}}
In 1998, several [[IOC]] members were forced to resign after it was uncovered that they had accepted bribes from Salt Lake Bid Committee co-heads Tom Welch and Dave Johnson in return for voting for Salt Lake City to hold the Games. In response to the scandal and a financial shortfall for the games, [[Mitt Romney]], then CEO of the private equity firm [[Bain Capital]] (and future [[United States presidential election, 2012|presidential candidate]]), was [[Mitt Romney#2002 Winter Olympics|hired]] as the new President and CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, leaving him and [[IOC President]] [[Dr. Jacques Rogge]] to contend with the public outcry and financial mess.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Kirk|title=In Olympics Success, Romney Found New Edge|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/us/politics/19romney.html|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=NY Times|date=September 19, 2007}}</ref>  Romney, Kem C. Gardner, a Utah commercial real estate developer, and Don Stirling, the Olympics' local marketing chief, raised "millions of dollars from Mormon families with pioneer roots: the Eccles family, whose forebears were important industrialists and bankers" to help rescue the games, according to a later report.<ref>[[Jim Rutenburg|Jim, Rutenburg]], [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/us/politics/support-for-romney-by-old-mormon-families.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&hp "Mormons’ First Families Rally Behind Romney"], ''The New York Times'', web pp. 2 & 3, July 16, 2012.

=== Disqualifications for doping ===
The 2002 games were the first Winter Olympics held after formation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]; as a result there were a large number of athletes disqualified following the new testing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Expect illegal drugs at 2012 Olympics |author=Bob Weiner & Caitlin Harrison |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/50948868-82/drug-games-olympics-athletes.html.csp |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref>

Athletes in [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] were disqualified for various reasons, including [[doping (sport)|doping]] by two Russians and one Spaniard, leading Russia to file protests and threaten to withdraw from the competition.

=== Judging controversies ===
{{Main|2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal}}
In the first week of the Games, a controversy in the pairs' figure skating competition culminated in the French judge's scores being thrown out and the Canadian team of [[Jamie Salé]] and [[David Pelletier]] being awarded a second gold medal. Allegations of bribery were leveled against many ice-skating judges, leading to the arrest of known criminal [[Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov]] in Italy (at the request of the United States). He was released by the Italian officials. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=7837|work= The St Petersburg Times |title= Taivanchik Hearing Ordered to Stay Put |author=Andrew Dampf |agency=Associated Press |date= August 13, 2002| accessdate=January 31, 2012 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

=== Utah Alcohol Laws ===
During the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]], the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (UDABC) relaxed enforcement of Utah's alcohol laws. This led  to the passing of less restrictive laws effected in May 2003.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news

==Security measures==
[[File:WinterOlympicsMP2002.png|thumb|Spc. Patrick Jean-Mary, of Warwick, R.I., inspects two forms of identification during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.]]
These Olympic games were the first since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for the Games. The [[Office of Homeland Security]] (OHS) designated the Olympics a [[National Special Security Event]] (NSSE).

Aerial surveillance and radar control was provided by the [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] of Marine Air Control Squadron 2, Detachment C, from [[Cherry Point, North Carolina]].

According to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI and NSA arranged with Qwest Communications to use intercept equipment for a period of less than six months around the time of  the 2002 Winter Olympics. The agencies monitored the content of all email and text communications in the Salt Lake City area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.html|title=New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach: Programs Cover 75% of Nation's Traffic, Can Snare Emails|author=Siobhan Gorman|author2=Jennifer Valentino-Devries|date=August 20, 2013|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}.

When he spoke during the opening ceremonies, [[Jacques Rogge]], presiding over his first Olympics as the IOC president, told the athletes of the United States:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91925 |title=Winter Olympics Open Amid Tight Security |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |date=February 8, 2002 }}</ref>
