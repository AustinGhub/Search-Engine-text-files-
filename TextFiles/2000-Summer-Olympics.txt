{{2000 Summer Olympics}}

The '''2000 Summer Olympic Games''' ({{lang-fr|Les Jeux olympiques d'été de 2000}}), officially known as the '''Games of the XXVII Olympiad''' and commonly known as '''Sydney 2000''' or the '''Millennium Olympic Games'''/'''Games of the New Millennium''', were an international [[multi-sport event]] which was held between 15 September and 1 October 2000 in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It was the second time that the Summer Olympics were held in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the first one being in [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne, Victoria, in 1956]].

Sydney was selected as the host city for the 2000 games in 1993. Teams from 199 countries participated. The United States won the most medals with 93, while Australia came in 4th with 58. The games cost was estimated to be [[Australian dollar|A$]]6.6&nbsp;billion. The Games received universal acclaim, with the organisation, volunteers, sportsmanship and Australian public being lauded in the international media. [[Bill Bryson]] from ''[[The Times]]'' called the Sydney Games "one of the most successful events on the world stage", saying that they "couldn't be better".<ref name="media">[http://www.coolrunning.com.au/general/2000e020.shtml How the media viewed the Sydney Olympics]. Cool Running. Retrieved on 19 April 2015.</ref> James Mossop of the ''[[Electronic Telegraph]]'' called the Games in an article "such a success that any city considering bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/4772754/Sydney-has-set-the-highest-standards-for-future-hosts.html|title=Sydney has set the highest standards for future hosts|first=James|last=Mossop|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=1 October 2000|accessdate=26 October 2013|location=London}}</ref> while Jack Todd in the Montreal Gazette suggested that the "IOC should quit while it's ahead. Admit there can never be a better Olympic Games, and be done with it", as "Sydney was both exceptional and the best".<ref name="media" /> In preparing for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] in [[London]], [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]] declared the Sydney Games the "benchmark for the spirit of the Games, unquestionably" and admitting that the London organising committee "attempted in a number of ways to emulate what [the Sydney organising committee] did."<ref>{{cite news|title=Sydney 2000 the Olympic Games benchmark, Sebastian Coe says|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/london-games/sydney-2000-the-olympic-games-benchmark-sebastian-coe-says/story-e6frgdg6-1226434578711|newspaper=The Australian|date=July 25, 2012}}</ref> These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]]. These were also the second Olympic Games to be held in spring.

The final medal tally was led by the [[United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics|United States]], followed by [[Russia at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Russia]] and [[China at the 2000 Summer Olympics|China]] with host [[Australia at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Australia]] at fourth place overall. Several World and Olympic records were broken during the games. With little or no controversies, the games were deemed generally successful with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world.

==Host city selection==
{{main|2000 Summer Olympics bids}}

Sydney won the right to host the Games on 24 September 1993, after being selected over [[Beijing]], [[Berlin]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Manchester]] in four rounds of voting, at the 101st [[IOC Session]] in [[Monte Carlo]], Monaco. The Australian city of [[Melbourne]] had lost out to [[Atlanta]] for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] four years earlier.<ref>[http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html IOC Vote History]</ref> Beijing lost its bid to host the games to Sydney in 1993, but was later awarded the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in July 2001.

==Costs==
In 2000, the [[Auditor-General of New South Wales]] reported that the Sydney Games cost [[Australian dollar|A$]]6.6&nbsp;billion, with a net cost to the public between A$1.7 and A$2.4&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liebreich.com/LDC/HTML/Olympics/London/Sydney.html |title=Sydney 2000&nbsp;– Auditor Slams Costs |website=liebreich.com |date=23 April 2003 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050207142926/http://www.liebreich.com/LDC/HTML/Olympics/London/Sydney.html |archivedate = 2005-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/agrep02v2/costofolympicgames.pdf |title=Cost of the Olympic and Paralympic Games |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620055157/http://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/agrep02v2/costofolympicgames.pdf |archivedate=2005-06-20 |pages=10–11 |quote=Olympic Co-ordination Authority ...

It has been estimated that the economic impact of the 2000 Olympics was that A$2.1&nbsp;billion has been shaved from public consumption. Economic growth was not stimulated to a net benefit and in the years after 2000, foreign tourism to NSW grew by less than tourism to Australia as a whole. A "multiplier" effect on broader economic development is not realised as a simple "multiplier" analysis fails to capture is that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: "Equestrian centres, softball compounds and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.smh.com.au/no-medals-for-economic-benefits-of-the-games/20080411-25ks.html | title = No medals for economic benefits of the Games|last = Saulwick | first = Jacob| date = 12 April 2008|accessdate =16 April 2008|work=Business Day| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200545/http://business.smh.com.au/no-medals-for-economic-benefits-of-the-games/20080411-25ks.html| archivedate= 16 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}  The article is based largely on a recent study by James Giesecke and John Madden from the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University.</ref>
In the years after the games, infrastructure issues have been of growing concern to citizens, especially those in the western suburbs of Sydney. Proposed rail links to Sydney's west have been estimated to cost in the same order of magnitude as the public expenditure on the games. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Chronological summary of the 2000 Summer Olympics==

===Preliminary matches&nbsp;– from 13 September===
Although the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony was not scheduled until 15 September, the [[Association football|football]] competitions began with preliminary matches on 13 September. Among the pre-ceremony fixtures, host nation Australia lost 1–0 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], which was the main stadium for the [[1956 Melbourne Olympics]].

===Day 1&nbsp;– 15 September===

====Cultural display highlights====
{{See also|2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}
[[File:2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony 1.JPEG|thumb|right|The [[2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony]] at [[Stadium Australia]], on 15 September 2000.]]
The opening ceremony began with a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the [[Stockman (Australia)|Australian stockmen]] and the importance of the [[Australian Stock Horse|stock horse]] in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster, [[Seven Network|Channel 7]].<ref>Commentary on the official DVD of the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics</ref>  This was introduced by a lone rider, [[Steve Jefferys]], and his rearing [[Australian Stock Horse]] ''Ammo''. At the cracking of Jefferys' [[stock whip|stockwhip]], a further 120 riders entered the Stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five [[Olympic Rings]], to a special Olympics version of the theme which [[Bruce Rowland]] had previously composed for the 1982 film ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]''.

The [[Advance Australia Fair|Australian National Anthem]] was sung, the first verse by [[Human Nature (band)|Human Nature]] and the second by [[Julie Anthony (singer)|Julie Anthony]].

The ceremony continued, showing many aspects of the land and its people:- the affinity of the mainly coastal-dwelling Australians with the sea that surrounds the "Island Continent". The [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] occupation of the land, the coming of the [[First Fleet]], the continued immigration from many nations and the rural industry on which the economy of the nation was built, including a display representing the harshness of rural life based on the paintings of Sir [[Sidney Nolan]]. Two memorable scenes were the representation of the "Heart" of the country by 200 [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] women from [[Central Australia]] who danced up ''"the mighty spirit of God to protect the Games"'' and the overwhelmingly noisy representation of the [[construction industry]] by hundreds of tap-dancing teenagers.

Because the wife of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], the IOC President, was seriously ill and not able to accompany her husband to the Olympics, former Australian Olympic Champion swimmer and member of the [[Parliament of New South Wales]], [[Dawn Fraser]], accompanied Samaranch during the Australian cultural display, explaining to him some of the cultural references that are unfamiliar to non-Australians.

====Formal presentation====
A record 199 nations entered the stadium, with a record 80 of them winning at least one medal. The only missing [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] member was [[Afghanistan]] (banned due to the extremist rule of the [[Taliban]]'s oppression of women and its prohibition of sports<ref>[https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/flash-from-the-past-afghans-shattered-2000-olympic-dreams-amended/] Afghanistan-Analysts. Retrieved on 19 April 2015.</ref>). The ceremony featured a unified entrance by the athletes of [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], using a specially designed [[Unification Flag|unification flag]]: a white background flag with a blue map of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The two teams competed separately, however. Four athletes from [[East Timor]] also marched in the parade of nations as [[Individual Olympic Athletes]] and marched directly before the Host country. Although the country-to-be had no National Olympic Committee then, they were allowed to compete under the [[Olympic Flag]] with country code [[Individual Olympic Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics|IOA]]. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[William Deane|Sir William Deane]], opened the games.

The [[Olympic Flag]] was carried around the arena by eight former Australian Olympic champions: [[Bill Roycroft]], [[Murray Rose]], [[Liane Tooth]], [[Gillian Rolton]], [[Marjorie Jackson]], [[Lorraine Crapp]], [[Michael Wenden]] and [[Nick Green (rower)|Nick Green]]. During the raising of the Olympics Flag, the [[Olympic Hymn]] was sung by the Millennium Choir of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia]] in Greek. Following this, [[Tina Arena]] sang a purpose-written pop song, ''The Flame''.<ref>[http://entertainment.time.com/2012/07/30/11-olympic-theme-songs-dissected/slide/tina-arena-flame-sydney-2000/ 11 Olympic Theme Songs, Dissected]. ''Time'' (2012-07-26). Retrieved on 2014-05-03.</ref>

The opening ceremony concluded with the lighting of the [[Olympic Flame]]. Former Australian Olympic champion [[Herb Elliott]] brought the Olympic Flame into the stadium. Then, celebrating 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games, former Australian women Olympic medalists: [[Betty Cuthbert]] and [[Raelene Boyle]], [[Dawn Fraser]], [[Shirley Strickland]] (later Shirley Strickland de la Hunty), [[Shane Gould]] and [[Debbie Flintoff-King]] brought the torch through the stadium, handing it over to [[Cathy Freeman]], who lit the flame in the cauldron within a circle of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp to the top of the stadium. When the cause of the problem was discovered, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued its course, and the ceremony concluded with a spectacular fireworks display.<ref>Information given by [[Ric Birch]], Director of Ceremonies, during an interview at the end of the official DVD of the 2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony</ref>

Despite his record achievements as an Australian sprinter, [[Peter Norman]] was not invited chiefly because he had participated in an [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|anti-racial protest]] during the awards ceremony for the 200m race in the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games.<ref name="CourierMail_Hurst_2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,20541398-10389,00.html|title=Peter Norman's Olympic statement|last=Hurst|first=Mike|date=7 October 2006|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=17 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119061605/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,20541398-10389,00.html |archivedate=2009-11-19}}</ref> The AOC disputes that he was snubbed, stating that no other former athletes were invited and that Norman was offered the same chance to buy tickets as other former athletes were.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/21/world/asia/australia-norman-olympic-apology/|title=Apology urged for Australian Olympian in 1968 black power protest|first=Hilary|last=Whiteman|publisher=CNN|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> During the Sydney Olympics, a reporter from The [[Washington Post]] found only one reference to Norman – an image on the side of a house in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] [a predominantly aboriginal area].<ref>Martin Flanagan.

===Day 2&nbsp;– 16 September===
[[File:2000 Olympics first medals.jpg|thumb|250px|Gold medallist [[Nancy Johnson (sport shooter)|Nancy Johnson]] (centre) of the U.S., raises her hands with silver medallist Cho-Hyun Kang (left), of South Korea, and bronze winner [[Jing Gao]] (right), of China, during the first medal ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games.]]

The first medals of the Games were awarded in the women's 10 metre [[air rifle]] competition, which was won by [[Nancy Johnson (sport shooter)|Nancy Johnson]] of the United States.

The [[Triathlon]] made its Olympic debut with the women's race. Set in the surroundings of the [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Brigitte McMahon]] representing Switzerland swam, cycled and ran to the first gold medal in the sport, beating the favoured home athletes such as Michelie Jones who won silver. McMahon only passed Jones in sight of the finish line.

The first star of the Games was [[Ian Thorpe]]. The 17-year-old Australian first set a new world record in the 400 m freestyle final before competing in an exciting 4 × 100 m freestyle final. Swimming the last leg, Thorpe passed the leading Americans and arrived in a new world record time, two tenths of a second ahead of the Americans. In the same event for women, the Americans also broke the world record, finishing ahead of the Netherlands and Sweden.

Samaranch had to leave for home, as his wife was severely ill. Upon arrival, his wife had already died. Samaranch returned to Sydney four days later. The Olympic flag was flown at half-staff during the period as a sign of respect to Samaranch's wife.

===Day 3&nbsp;– 17 September===
Canadian [[Simon Whitfield]] sprinted away in the last 100 metres of the men's triathlon, becoming the inaugural winner in the event.

On the cycling track, [[Robert Bartko]] beat fellow German [[Jens Lehmann (cyclist)|Jens Lehmann]] in the individual pursuit, setting a new Olympic Record. [[Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel]] set a world record in the semi-finals the same event for women.

In the swimming pool, American [[Tom Dolan]] beat the world record in the 400 m [[Medley swimming|medley]], successfully defending the title he won in [[Atlanta]] four years prior. Dutchwoman [[Inge de Bruijn]] also clocked a new world record, beating her own time in the 100 m butterfly final to win by more than a second.

===Day 4&nbsp;– 18 September===
The main event for the Australians on the fourth day of the Games was the 200 m freestyle. Dutchman [[Pieter van den Hoogenband]] had broken the world record in the semi-finals, taking it from the new Australian hero [[Ian Thorpe]], who came close to the world record in his semi-final heat. As the final race finished, Van den Hoogenband's time was exactly the same as in the semi-finals, finishing ahead of Thorpe by half a second.

China won the [[gold medal]] in the men's team all-around gymnastics competition, after being the runner-up in the previous two Olympics. The other medals were taken by [[Ukraine]] and Russia, respectively.

Zijlaard-van Moorsel lived up to the expectations set by her world record in cycling in the semis by winning the gold medal.

===Day 7&nbsp;– 21 September===
Controversy erupted at the Women's Gymnastics All-Around final, when gymnast after gymnast fell on the vault. Some gymnasts were physically injured, and all were shaken, but nothing was done to try to discover the reason most gymnasts were having severe problems. Finally, in the middle of the second round, it was determined that the vault horse had been set 5&nbsp;cm too low&nbsp;– a small amount, possibly, but to these world-class athletes, enough of a difference to have thrown off their impeccable timing to the extent that true performance was impossible. This situation led directly to the elimination of [[Svetlana Khorkina]] from consideration as the top all-around gymnast.

===Day 9&nbsp;– 23 September===
By rowing in the winning coxless four, [[Steve Redgrave]] of Great Britain became a member of a select group who had won gold medals at five consecutive Olympics.

The swimming 4 x 100-metre medley relay of B.J. Bedford, [[Megan Quann]] (Jendrick), [[Jenny Thompson (athlete)|Jenny Thompson]] and [[Dara Torres]] became the first women's relay under 4-minutes, swimming 3:58 and setting a world record, claiming the gold medal for the United States.

===Day 10&nbsp;– 24 September===
[[Rulon Gardner]], never a [[NCAA]] champion or a world medalist, beat [[Alexander Karelin]] of Russia to win gold in the super heavyweight class, [[Greco-Roman wrestling]]. Karelin had won gold in [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul]], [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]]. Before this fight he had never lost in international competition, had been unbeaten in all competitions in 13 years, and had not surrendered a point in a decade.

===Day 11&nbsp;– 25 September===
[[File:Cathy400 mediafrenzy.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Cathy Freeman]] after the 400 metre final]]
Australian [[Cathy Freeman]] won the 400 metre final in front of a jubilant Sydney crowd at the [[Stadium Australia|Olympic Stadium]], ahead of Lorraine Graham of Jamaica and [[Katharine Merry]] of Great Britain. Freeman's win made her the first competitor in Olympic Games history to light the [[Olympic Flame]] and then go on to win a [[Gold Medal]]. The attendance at the stadium was 112,524 - the largest attendance for any sport in Olympic Games history.

In a men's basketball pool match between the [[United States men's national basketball team|USA]] and [[France national basketball team|France]], the USA's [[Vince Carter]] made one of the most famous [[slam dunk|dunks]] in basketball history. After getting the ball off a steal, the 6'6"/1.98 m Carter drove to the basket, with 7'2"/2.18 m centre [[Frédéric Weis]] in his way. Carter jumped, spread his legs in midair, scraped Weis' head on the way up, and dunked. The French media dubbed the feat ''le dunk de la mort'' ("the dunk of death").

===Day 14&nbsp;– 28 September===
The [[Canadian flag]] at athletes' village is lowered to half-staff as Canadian athletes pay tribute to former prime minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] after hearing of his [[Death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau|death]] in Montreal (Because of the time difference, it was 29 September in Sydney when Trudeau died). The Canadian flag flew at half-staff for the remainder of the Olympics, on orders from both IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister [[Lloyd Axworthy]], as the state funeral did not take place until 3 October.

===Day 16&nbsp;– 30 September===
[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] won a historic gold medal over [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the Men's Olympic [[association football|Football]] Final at the Olympic Stadium. The game went to a penalty shootout, which was won by Cameroon 5–3.<ref>{{cite web | title = Patrick Mboma|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/halloffame/m/n214045822.shtml  | accessdate =9 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517151346/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/halloffame/m/n214045822.shtml |archivedate=2013-05-17}}</ref>

{{See also|2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony}}
[[File:Fireworks, Sydney Harbour Bridge, 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|Olympic colours on the[[ Sydney Harbour Bridge]].]]
The last event of the games was the Men's Marathon, contested on a course that started in North Sydney. The event was won by [[Ethiopia]]n Genzhnge Abera, with Eric Wananina second and Tesefe Tola, also of Ethiopia third. It was the first time since the 1968 Olympics that an Ethiopian had won the gold medal in this event.

The Closing Ceremony commenced with [[Christine Anu]] singing her version of the [[Warumpi Band]]'s song, [[My Island Home]]. She performed with several [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] dancers atop the Geodome Stage in the middle of the stadium, around which several hundred umbrella and lampbox kids created an image of Aboriginal dreamtime.

The Geodome Stage was used throughout the ceremony, which is a flat stage which is mechanically raised into the shape of a [[Geode]].

IOC President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] declared at the Closing Ceremony,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/sports/sydney-2000-closing-ceremony-a-fond-farewell-from-australia.html|title=Sydney 2000: Closing Ceremony; A fond farewell from Australia|date=2 October 2000|first=Jere|last=Longman|newspaper=New York Times| accessdate=12 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>
{{quote|"I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever."}}
Subsequent Summer Olympics held in [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]] have been described by Samaranch's successor, [[Jacques Rogge]], as "unforgettable, dream Games", "truly exceptional" and "happy and glorious games" respectively&nbsp;– the practice of declaring games the "best ever" having been retired after the 2000 games.

The [[Olympic Hymn]] was sung by soprano [[Yvonne Kenny]]. The ceremony also featured performing artists such as [[Jimmy Barnes]], [[INXS]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Slim Dusty]], [[Christine Anu]], [[Nikki Webster]], [[John Paul Young]], [[Men at Work]], Melbourne-based singer [[Vanessa Amorosi]], [[Tommy Emmanuel]], and pop duo [[Savage Garden]].

The Games were then handed over to their modern birthplace, [[Athens]], which succeeded Sydney as Olympic host city. Two Greek flags were raised; one to honour the birthplace of the Olympics, and the other to honour Athens. The ceremony concluded with a huge [[fireworks]] display on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]. The fireworks display itself concluded with a very low flyover of Stadium Australia by an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RAAF F-111C]] which performed a [[Dump and burn|dump-and-burn]] manoeuvre synchronised with the extinction of the [[Olympic Flame]]. This created the appearance of the flame being carried away into the sky, flying in a northeasterly direction out across Sydney Harbour and ultimately towards Athens in a symbolic handover.

In honour of her gold medal win during the games, [[Cathy Freeman]] represented [[Oceania]] in carrying the Olympic flag, joining Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] (Africa), [[John Glenn]] (The Americas), [[Kazuyoshi Funaki]] (Asia), [[Lech Wałęsa]] (Europe), [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] (Environment), [[Jean-Claude Killy]] (Sport), and [[Steven Spielberg]] (Culture) when it was raised again, at the [[2002 Winter Olympics|XIX Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Salt Lake City]]; the opening ceremony there took place on 8 February 2002.

Although demonstration sports were abolished in 1992 the Sydney Olympics featured [[Wheelchair Racing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|wheelchair racing]] as exhibition events on the athletics schedule.<ref>{{cite web|title= Reflections on the Olympic Wheelchair Racing Exhibition Races|url=http://www.ncpad.org/yourwrites/fact_sheet.php?sheet=267|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hbshW3VN|archivedate=17 June 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref>

Special [[quarantine]] conditions were introduced to allow entry of horses into Australia to participate in equestrian events,<ref>{{cite web|title=Strict quarantine conditions for overseas horses competing in the Sydney 2000 Games|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/about/media-centre/dept-releases/1999/strict_quarantine_conditions_for_overseas_horses_competing_in_the_sydney_2000_games|publisher=Department of Agriculture|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=26 November 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507085950/http://www.agriculture.gov.au/about/media-centre/dept-releases/1999/strict_quarantine_conditions_for_overseas_horses_competing_in_the_sydney_2000_games |archivedate=2015-05-07}}</ref> avoiding the need for such events to take place elsewhere as had happened at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne.

[[Eritrea at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Eritrea]], [[Federated States of Micronesia at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Federated States of Micronesia]] and [[Palau at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Palau]] made their Olympic debut this year.

Afghanistan was the only 1996 participant that did not participate in 2000, having been banned due to the extremist rule of the Taliban's oppression of women and its prohibition of sports.

==Organisation==
[[File:SOCOG org structure 1998.gif|thumb|300px|SOCOG organisational structure circa 1998&nbsp;– five groups and 33 divisions reporting to the CEO are organised primarily along functional lines with only a limited number of divisions (e.g. Interstate Football and Villages) anticipating a venue focussed design.]]
[[File:SOCOG org structure 1999.gif|thumb|300px|SOCOG organisational structure circa 1999&nbsp;– functional divisions and precinct/venue streams are organised in a matrix structure linked to the Main Operations Centre (MOC). Some functions such as Project Management (in the Games Coordination group) continue to exist largely outside this matrix structure.]]

===Organisations responsible for the Olympics===
A number of quasi-government bodies were responsible for the construction, organisation and execution of the Sydney Games. These included:
*the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), primarily responsible for the staging of the Games
*Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), primarily responsible for construction and oversight
*Olympic Roads & Transport Authority (ORTA)
*[[Olympic Security Command Centre]] (OSCC)
*Olympic Intelligence Centre (OIC)
*[[Joint Task Force Gold|JTF Gold]] the [[Australian Defence Force]] Joint Taskforce Gold
*[Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation (nominally part of SOCOG)
*[[IBM]] provider of technology and the Technical Command Centre
*[[Telstra]] provider of telecommunications

These organisations worked closely together and with other bodies such as:
*the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC)
*the [[Australian Olympic Committee]] (AOC)
*the other 197 [[National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs)
*the 33 [[List of International Sport Federations|International Sports Federations]] (IFs)
*all three levels of Australian government (federal, state and local)
*dozens of official sponsor and hundreds of official supplier companies

These bodies are often collectively referred to as the "Olympic Family".

===Organisation of the Paralympics===
Organisation of the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] was the responsibility of [[Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee|SPOC]] the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee. However much of the planning and operation of the Paralympic Games was outsourced to SOCOG such that most operational programmes planned both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

===Other Olympic events===
Organisation of the Games included not only the actual sporting events but also the management (and sometimes construction) of the sporting venues and surrounding precincts, the organisation of the [[Sydney Olympic Arts Festival]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]]. The relay began in Greece and travelled to Australia via numerous Oceania island nations.

===Phases of the Olympic project===
The staging of the Olympics were treated as a [[project]] on a vast scale, with the project broken into several broad phases:
*1993 to 1996&nbsp;– positioning
*1997&nbsp;– going operational
*1998&nbsp;– procurement/venuisation
*1999&nbsp;– testing/refinement
*2000&nbsp;– implementation
*2001&nbsp;– post implementation and wind-down

===SOCOG organisational design===
The internal organisation of SOCOG evolved over the phases of the project and changed, sometimes radically, several times.

In late 1998 the design was principally ''functional''. The top two tiers below the CEO [[Sandy Hollway]] consisted of five ''groups'' (managed by Group General Managers and the Deputy CEO) and twenty ''divisions'' (managed by divisional General Managers), which in turn were further broken up into ''programmes'' and sub-programmes or ''projects''.

In 1999 functional areas (FAs) broke up into geographic precinct and venue teams (managed by Precinct Managers and Venue Managers) with functional area staff reporting to both the FA manager and the venue manager. Ie, SOCOG moved to a matrix structure. The Interstate Football division extant in 1998 was the first of these geographically based venue teams.

===Volunteer programme===
The origins of the volunteer programme for Sydney 2000 dates back to the bid, as early as 1992.

On 17 December 1992, a group of Sydney citizens, interested in the prospect of hosting the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games, gathered for a meeting at Sports House, at [[Wentworth Park]] in Sydney.

In the period leading up to 1999, after Sydney had won the bid, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500. These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer programme was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and [[TAFE]]. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.

During the Olympic games tens of thousands of volunteers, the official figure was placed at 46,967,<ref>{{cite web|title= Sydney 2000 International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=2000|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iStIioea|archivedate=22 July 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref> helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city. They were honoured with a parade like the athletes had a few days before.

The Olympic torch is represented through a blue smoke trail, which draws the iconic peaks of the Sydney Opera House.

===The Mascots===
{{main|Olly, Syd and Millie}}
The official [[mascot]]s chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics were Syd the [[platypus]], Millie the [[echidna]], and Olly the [[kookaburra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/10/74/article211987410.shtml|title=Syd, Olly and Millie - mascots of the 2000 Olympic Summer Games|publisher=Beijing2008|date=5 August 2004|accessdate=25 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517163244/http://en.beijing2008.cn/10/74/article211987410.shtml |archivedate=2013-05-17}}</ref>  and were designed by Matthew Hattan and [[Jozef Szekeres]].

There was also an unofficial mascot, [[Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat]], which was popularised by comedy team [[Roy and HG|Roy Slaven and HG Nelson]] on the TV series ''[[The Dream with Roy and HG]]''.

==Medals and bouquets==
The [[bronze medals]] for the 2000 Olympics were created from melted down [[Australian 1 cent coin|Australian 1 cent]] and [[Australian 2 cent coin|2 cent coins]]<ref>[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3610904a2a248a913e4212fb48256b0500179d95/$file/gc2001.pdf "Other Olympic and Paralympic Products"&nbsp;— on page 17 (just before page 18) of the Gold Corporation&nbsp;— 2001 Annual Report&nbsp;— Publication by the Parliament of Western Australia]</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3MKT/is_166_108/ai_64838756 Australians add local color to medals for Olympic Games&nbsp;— Publication date: 28 August 2000]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>{{snd}}which had been removed from circulation from 1992 onward.

==Awards and commendations==
The International Olympic Committee awarded Sydney and its inhabitants with the "Pierre de Coubertin Trophy" in recognition of the collaboration and happiness shown by the people of Sydney during the event to all the athletes and visitors around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title= Olympic History|url=http://olympics.india-server.com/olympics-history.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iStJALNt|archivedate=22 July 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>
