{{2000 Summer Olympics}}
The '''2000 Paralympic Games'''  were held in [[Sydney, Australia]], from 18 to 29 October. In September 1993, Sydney won the rights to host the 2000 Paralympic Games. To secure this right it was expected that the New South Wales Government would  underwrite the budget for the games.<ref name= "ref1">{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/4245/bp2_6.pdf|title=Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games|publisher=NSW Treasury|date=1999–2000|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>
The Sydney games were the eleventh [[Summer Paralympic Games]], where an estimated 3800 athletes took part in the programme. They commenced with the opening ceremony on 18 October 2000. It was followed by the 11 days of fierce international competition and was the second largest sporting event ever held in Australia. They were also the first Paralympic Games outside the Northern Hemisphere.

== Finance ==
The games was estimated to cost $157 million, with the NSW Government and Commonwealth Government contributing $25 million each. The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) contributed $18 million, within the bid estimates. The Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC) entered into a Host City contract with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), which outlines the SPOC’s obligations in hosting the Paralympic Games. To cover the costs, other revenue was raised via sponsorship and ticket sales. The 110,000 seat Stadium Australia was completed three months early in February 1999, this stadium was funded mainly by the private sector at an estimated cost of $690 million, the Government contributed $124 million to this project. Though there is no budgeted profit, if any profit is made though the games, repayment to the Federal and State Governments is the first priority. In October 1998, governing bodies of the Paralympics including the SOCOG and the Sydney Olympic Organising Committee initiated a call for volunteers. An estimated total of forty-one thousand Australians answered this call, non-including those sourced from specialist community groups.<ref name= "ref1"/>

==Environment==
[[File:141100 - Olympic Park water view - 3b - 2000 Sydney venue photo.jpg|thumb|right|Daytime view of pond with waterlilies at Sydney Olympic Park during the 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games]]The major focus between 1999-2000 was completion of the first stage of the Millennium Parklands. This is composed of 450 hectares of landscape, with up to 40 kilometers of pedestrian and cycle trails. This major first stage included focus on the surrounding Olympic facilities, providing a beautiful landscape for recreational activities, conservation and environmental education/preservation. During this time work on the Water Reclamation and Management Scheme (WRAMS) will continue to progress. The WRAMS will be in use during the games with the first stage (recycled water to be used for flushing and irrigation) to be implemented. This system will continue after the games and will be fully developed after the games has been completed. The WRAMS system is only one of the many water saving management strategies to be used during the games period. Plans to use stormwater runoff from Newington to be used as irrigation and a requirement for Olympic venues to utilise water saving techniques and devices are also some of the other water saving plans. Stormwater from the Stadium Australia roof is to be collected and used to irrigate the central stadium. An environmental education program is also delivered throughout 1999-2000 to ensure that Homebush Bay and the Sydney Olympics and Paralympics continue to be recognised for their commitment to the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/4245/bp2_6.pdf|title=Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games|publisher=NSW Treasury|date=1999–2000|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

==Administration==
The Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The Games were organised by the Sydney Paralyampic Organising Committee led by President [[John Grant (neurosurgeon)|Dr John Grant]] and Chief Executive Officer [[Lois Appleby]]. The SOCOG was established at the same time as the Sydney Paralympic organising Committee on 12 November 1993 by the Office of Olympic Co-ordination. In January 1995, SPOC became a public company controlled by the Government, receiving support by both State and Commonwealth Governments. A board of directors including the Premier, Minister for the Olympics, the Treasurer and the Minister for Sport and Recreation conducted administration. The Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee was responsible for planning and staging the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games including tickets, information on events and disability categorisation, converting Olympic venues to Paralympic venues, conducting events, facilitating drug testing, arranging broadcasting, housing for athletes, arranging medal ceremonies, transporting athletes and conducting the Paralympic torch relay. The Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee also regulated the use of Paralympic Games indicia and images. A committee known as the Joint Working Group was established in June 1997, linking the Boards of both the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. On 29 November, the Sydney Games Administration Act 2000 was passed. The legislation caused the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee to dissolve from 1 January 2001, its assets and liabilities were transferred to the Olympic Coordination Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3486|title=Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC)|publisher=NSW Government State Records|date=1 January 2001|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

==Political context==
[[File:201000 - Opening Ceremony Yothu Yindi perform 3 - 3b - 2000 Sydney opening ceremony photo.jpg|thumb|right|Yothu Yindi performs at the Sydney opening ceremony]]The Sydney 2000 Paralympics was only the sixth time that the Paralympics had been held in the same city as the Olympic Games. Removal of the Olympic Rings was viewed by some as just another snub in a long line of poor decisions made by the IOC. The launch of the Paralympics was somewhat overshadowed as the Olympics minister Michael Knight announced his retirement on the same day. His timing was viewed by many as insensitive to the Paralympics. A day after this, Sydney politicians organised a large city rally to thank Olympic volunteers, however they had arranged for this to occur on the same day as the Paralympic torch relay. The Government soon realised the clash and refused to alter the day of the rally.

Paralympic organisers received praise for selecting [[Kylie Minogue]] and indigenous Australian band [[Yothu Yindi]] for its opening party, Olympic organisers took note of this and quickly booked both for their closing ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/oct/09/worlddispatch.comment2|title=Don't forget 'les autres'|publisher=Patrick Barkham|date=9 October 2000|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

==Controversy==
{{main|Cheating at the Paralympic Games}}
The Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games were marred by one of sport's biggest controversies which saw a classification of athlete removed from the next two Paralympic games.<ref name="Tomlinson">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2459172/Spanish-basketball-team-pretended-disabled-win-Paralympic-gold-guilty-fraud.html|title=Man that led shameful Spanish basketball team who pretended to be disabled to win Paralympic gold found guilty of fraud|publisher=Simon Tomlinson|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> Fernando Vicente Martin, former head of the Spanish Federation for Mentally Handicapped Sports, allowed athletes with no disabilities to compete at the Games in order to win the gold medal. The team at the centre of the row was the Spanish basketball team, who won the gold medal in the [[Basketball ID at the 2000 Summer Paralympics|Basketball ID]], beating Russia 87-63, despite fielding a team mainly composed of athletes with no intellectual disability.<ref name="Tomlinson"/> It was claimed that at least 10 of the 12 Spanish players had no disability, rather were recruited to improve the teams performance and guarantee future funding. Martin was later suspended by the IPC and expelled by the Spanish Paralympic Committee.<ref name=":0" />

The athletes were quickly exposed and the IPC reacted by removing all events from the following Games for athletes with intellectual disabilities. The decision was overturned for the 2012 Games in London. Along with the controversy surrounding the Spanish basketball team, the games turned over 11 positive doping tests out of a total 630. Of these 11 positive tests, 10 were from male athletes and 1 from a female athlete. This leaves the games with the highest number of positive tests from the 1992 - 2008 Paralympics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://paralympicanorak.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/is-doping-a-bigger-problem-at-the-paralympic-games-than-the-olympic-games/|title=Is doping a bigger problem at the Paralympic Games than the Olympic Games?|publisher=paralympicanorak|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>

==Mascot==
[[File:141100 - Australian mascot Lizzie Lizard - 3b - 2000 Sydney mascot photo.jpg|thumb|left|2000 Summer Paralympics mascot Lizzie the Lizard waves to the audience during the games. The character represents an Australian frilled-neck lizard.]]The mascot for the 2000 Paralympics was "'''Lizzie'''" the [[Frill-necked Lizard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.com/31/87/article211928731.shtml|title=A Brief History of the Olympic and Paralympic Mascots|publisher=Beijing2008|date=5 August 2004|accessdate=25 October 2006}}</ref>  The frill of the Paralympic mascot was coloured in green and gold and represented the country via the shape. The ochre colour of Lizzie’s body aimed to mirror the colour of the land. The frill neck lizard is a native Australian animal which inhabits northern parts of the country. The lizard was chosen because of its will to survive along with its tenacity, it carries the Paralympic message of power and pride to both Australians and international audiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sydney-2000/mascot|title=Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games - Lizzy|publisher=International Paralympic Committee (IPC)|date=n.d.|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> The strength, determination and attitude of Lizzie symbolise the character traits of all Paralympic Athletes.<ref name="ref9">{{cite book |last=Brittain |first=Ian |date=2012 |title=From Stoke-Mandeville to Stratford: A History of the Summer Paralympic Games|publisher= Illinois: Common Ground}}</ref>

Lizzie has been given the voice of Olivia Newton-John, a well-known Australian singer, actor and entertainer. Olivia made performances with Lizzie leading up to the Games, spreading the word about excellence within the Paralympic Community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1997/oreXXVI18/oreXXVI18f.pdf|title=Olympic Games|publisher=Olympic Information Center|date=1997|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

The outstanding visibility and community engagement to Lizzie the lizard ultimately led to marketing success, unrivalled by the three olympic mascots. Lizzie captured the imagination of the public, leading to the iconic representation at the Paralympic games.  The Australian Paralympic Committee noted the significant branding capitol and realised that this could be leveraged in the future.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Legg |first1=David |last2=Gilbert |first2=Keith |editor1-last=Darcy |editor1-first=Simon | editor2-last=Appleby |editor2-first=Louis| title=Paralympic Legacies |publisher= Illinois: Common Ground Publishers |date=2011 | pages=75–95 |chapter=Chapter 8: Sydney 2000: Moving from Post-Hoc Legacy to Strategic Vision and Operational Partnerships}}</ref>

== Logo ==
The 2000 Paralympic games logo was representative of a dynamic human form leaping triumphantly forward and 'breaking through' towards the games. Not only was this depicted through the logo, but so too was the Olympic Torch and the sails of the famous Sydney Opera House, through the use of three graphic shapes. The colours used are unique to Australia and represent the blue of Sydney Harbour, the warm red of the Earth, and lush forrest green.  The logo embodies Sydney's vitality, Australia's spirit, and the achievements of a Paralympic athlete. 

==Ceremonies==
[[File:151100 - Opening Ceremony Australian team - 3b - 2000 Sydney opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|The Australian team at the opening ceremony]]
The opening ceremony commenced on Wednesday 18 October at 8.00 pm with over 6000 performers taking part.<ref name="ref9"/> Australian artist Jeffrey St. John sang "''[[Advance Australia Fair]]''" and "''The Challenge''" at the Opening Ceremony. [[Kylie Minogue]] sang "''[[Waltzing Matilda]]''" and "''[[Celebration (Kool & the Gang song)|Celebration]]''" at the Opening Ceremony. Australian actor [[Bryan Brown]] was selected as Ceremony narrator for the evening.
Other performers for the Opening Ceremony included the band [[Yothu Yindi]], [[Nathan Cavaleri]], [[Melissa Ippolito]], [[Taxiride]], [[Billy Thorpe]], [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], [[Renee Geyer]], [[Tina Harris (Australian Musician)|Tina Harris]], [[Vanessa Amorosi]] and [[Christine Anu]]. Australian country artist [[Graeme Connors]] sang his song 'Being Here', which was specially written for the event.
Addresses were given by Dr [[John Grant (neurosurgeon)|John Grant]], President of the SPOC and Dr [[Robert Steadward]], President of the IPC prior to Sir [[William Deane]] declaring the official opening of the games. This was followed by [[Tracey Cross]], a blind swimmer, taking the oath on behalf of the athletes and Mary Longden, an Equestrian Referee, taking the oath on behalf of the officials.
The Paralympic torch entered the stadium and was passed from [[Katrina Webb]] to [[Louise Sauvage]] who then lit the cauldron.<ref name="ref9"/>

The closing ceremony took place on Sunday 29 October at 7.30 pm. The athletes intermingled with other nations and took to the stage for a party filled with fire, emotion and celebration. During this time, the Paralympic flag was handed over to the Athens Paralympic Organising Committee to the sounds of [[Mikis Theodorakis]] 'Axion Esti, Tis Dikiosinis Helie Noite' performed by the Millennium Choir. The [[Australia]]n group, [[The Seekers]], sang their hit song "''[[The Carnival Is Over]]''" as the finale to the Closing Ceremony.  [[Judith Durham]], who had a [[broken hip]], sang from a [[wheelchair]].<ref name="ref9"/>

==Torch relay==
[[File:Sydney 2000 Paralympic Torch Relay.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Paralympic Torch, designed by Robert Jurgens, now placed in front of [[ANZ Stadium]]]]

The Torch Relay Programme's objectives were to develop a route and an event which would help maintain momentum between the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games, promote the Paralympic Games and encourage ticket purchases. It was also to safely deliver the Paralympic flame to the Opening Ceremony.

While the relay visited each Australian capital city, it also focused strongly on Sydney and the surrounding region, as this was the main catchment area for ticket sales.

The Paralympic Torch Relay succeeded in generating community and media support for the Games, with crowds in many areas and significant crowds lining the Sydney metropolitan route in the final two days of the relay.

The event, which commenced with a lighting ceremony at Parliament House, Canberra on 5 October 2000, involved 920 torchbearers, each of whom carried the flame an average of 500 metres. After visiting each capital city (except Sydney) by air, the relay travelled in New South Wales (NSW) from Moss Vale through the Southern Highlands, Illawarra, Campbelltown, Penrith, Windsor, Hunter and Central Coast areas before heading to Sydney.[[File:201000 - Opening Ceremony athletics competitor Louise Sauvage flame lighting 6 - 3b - 2000 Sydney opening ceremony photo.jpg|thumb|right|Australian athletics competitor Louise Sauvage lights the cauldron with the Paralympic Flame at the finish of the torch relay, 2000 Summer Paralympics Opening Ceremony]]

Highlights included:

* The creation of the Paralympic flame during an Indigenous lighting ceremony on the forecourt of Parliament House, Canberra, with Paralympian David Hall (a tennis player) as the first torchbearer. The Australian Prime Minister attended this event.
* The use of a Royal Australian Air Force Falcon 900 Executive jet to convey the Paralympic flame around Australia.
* The Paralympic flame being carried across the arch of the Sydney Harbour Bridge (17 October 2000) by four torchbearers.

== Sports and impairment groups ==

The games included 561 separate medal events in 18 sports. For the first time, women's events were included in the [[powerlifting]] programme and [[wheelchair rugby]], a demonstration sport at the [[1996 Paralympics]], was contested as a medal-awarding sport.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sydney 2000 - General Information |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]] |date=August 2001 |url=http://www.paralympic.org/Paralympic_Games/Past_Games/Sydney_2000/ |accessdate=2011-07-12 }}</ref>

==Games highlights==
The Sydney Paralympics were deemed the "best Games ever" by Dr. [[Robert Steadward]] (then president of the International Paralympic Committee).  The games were Australia’s most successful in history, with the nation achieving their highest medal count.  Of the 149 medals won, 63 were gold, 39 silver, and 47 were bronze, from ten different sports. Ticket sales exceeded organisers’ initial targets, with 1.1 million tickets sold; nearly twice that of the previous 1996 Atlanta Paralympics [[1996 Summer Paralympics]].

[[File:221000 - Swimming Siobhan Paton action 2 - 3b - 2000 Sydney event photo.jpg|thumb|left|Action shot of Australian swimming star Siobhan Paton, who won six gold medals at the 2000 Summer Paralympics]]
The Australian team had a number of notable gold-medal winning performances. Individual achievements included swimmer [[Siobhan Paton]]’s six gold medals in the 200m SM14 individual medley, and S14 100m freestyle, 50m butterfly, 50m backstroke, 200m freestyle, and 50m freestyle. She set nine world records in the process.

[[Tim Sullivan (athlete)|Tim Sullivan]] topped the track and field medal tally with five gold medals.  Sullivan won three  gold medals in the T38 200m, 100m, and 400m events, and won two gold medals in relay events alongside [[Darren Thrupp]], [[Adrian Grogan]] and [[Kieran Ault-Connell]] (T38 4X400m and 4X100m races).  The top performing female track and field athlete was [[Lisa Llorens]], who won three gold medals from the F20 high jump, long jump and T20 200m.  Lorens also won a silver medal in the T20 100m. Other track medallists included [[Neil Fuller]] won two golds in the T44 200m, and 400m events, as well as one individual bronze medal in the T44 100m.  Fuller later combined with [[Tim Matthews (athlete)|Tim Matthews]], [[Stephen Wilson (athlete)|Stephen Wilson]] and [[Heath Francis]] to win another two gold medals in the T45 4X100m relay and T46 4X400m relay.

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] had approximately 200 staff in Sydney for the Olympic games, 6 of whom stayed on to cover the Paralympic games.  The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired four one-hour shows of the Paralympic Games after the event was finished.  

[[Television New Zealand|TV New Zealand]] also aired four one-hour specials of the games post event. 

In the United States, [[CBS]] broadcast a special called 'Role Models for the 21st Century: The Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games'. The special was two hours long and aired in November.

The [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)]] allowed viewers the opportunity to express their opinions towards the games.  Comments were posted under the heading "Has the Sydney Paralympics been a success?" on their website.  One viewer, Carole Neale from England was cited as posting: 

:''"I am so disappointed to find the coverage limited to less than an hour per evening, on at a time when most people are still travelling home from work, and dismissed to BBC2, unlike the Olympics which had a prime time evening slot on BBC1 as well as constant live coverage"''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = The Paralympic Games Explained|last = Brittain|first = Ian|publisher = Routledge|year = 2010|isbn = |location = 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, OX14 4RN|pages = 74-75}}</ref>

Dame [[Tanni Grey-Thompson]], multiple Paralympic gold medallist for Great Britain, later said of the Sydney Games:
:''"Sydney 2000 will always hold a special place in the hearts of everyone who was there. The Aussies love their sport and they treated us simply as sportsmen and women. We weren’t regarded as role models or inspirations, we were competitors. Some of us won gold medals, most didn’t, but, hey, that’s life. Sydney was phenomenal because, from day one, you felt there was something extraordinarily special in the air. Sydney was an athletic Disneyland, it was where magic happened. It probably marked the time and place when Paralympians genuinely became part of the Olympic Movement."''<ref>[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080831/SPORTCOLUMNISTS/440583136/-1/NEWS "Please don't cry for them"], ''The National'', 31 August 2008</ref>
