The '''2002 FIFA World Cup''' was the 17th staging of the [[FIFA World Cup]] which took place from 31 May to 30 June 2002 in South Korea and Japan. It was the first World Cup to be held in Asia, the first to be held on a continent other than Europe or the Americas, the last World Cup during which the [[golden goal]] rule was in force and the only World Cup to be jointly hosted by more than one nation as FIFA amended its statutes in 2004 to officially forbid co-hosting bids.<ref name="FIFAreleaseSA">{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=25395.html|title=Host nation of 2010 FIFA World Cup – South Africa|date=15 May 2004|publisher=[[FIFA]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112201002/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=25395.html|archivedate=12 November 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref> [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] won the tournament for a record fifth time, winning [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] against [[German national football team|Germany]] 2–0.<ref>{{cite news |title=Brazil crowned world champions |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/germany_v_brazil/newsid_2067000/2067939.stm |date=30 June 2002 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=27 March 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66UD7w04x |archivedate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=no }}</ref> The victory meant Brazil qualified for the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]] for the fifth time, representing the World.

The tournament had several upsets and surprise results which included the defending champions [[France national football team|France]] being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point and second favourites [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] also being eliminated in the group stage. Additionally, [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] surprisingly took third place and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] managed to reach the semi-finals, beating [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] en route. Another big shock came in the opening match of the tournament when underdog debutantes Senegal defeated defending champions France, going on to reach the quarter-finals only to be beaten by Turkey. However, the most potent team at the tournament, Brazil, prevailed and they became the first ever nation to win five World Cups.

==Host selection==
{{Main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}
South Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan, and Mexico presented three rival bids. However, the two Asian countries agreed to unite their bids shortly before the decision was made, and they were chosen unanimously in preference to Mexico. This was the first (and so far the only) World Cup to be hosted by two countries.

At the time the decision was made, Japan had never qualified for a World Cup finals (although the Japanese did subsequently qualify for the 1998 competition). The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022.  (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament.  They were defending Olympic champions from 1928).

The unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone.<ref name="Sports Marketing: Beer for Breakfast">{{cite web|last1=Goddard|first1=Lexie|title=Sports Marketing: Beer for Breakfast|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/sports-marketing-beer-breakfast-world-cup-matches-will-start-school-run-marketers-having-rethink-promotions/142390?preferredformat=mobile|website=Campaign|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref> With games taking place in the European morning, some schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up communal watching events before the start of work.<ref name="School succumbs to football fever">{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Polly|title=School succumbs to football fever|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jun/11/schools.uk7|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref><ref name="World Cup 2002: a shot at goal">{{cite web|last1=Quick|first1=Chris|title=World Cup 2002: a shot at goal|url=https://www.accountancylive.com/world-cup-2002-shot-goal|website=Accountancy Live|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

==Qualification==
{{Main|2002 FIFA World Cup qualification}}
A total of 199 teams attempted to qualify for the 2002 World Cup which qualification process began with the preliminary draw held in Tokyo on 7 December 1999. Defending [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|champions]] [[France national football team|France]] and co-hosts [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] qualified automatically and did not have to play any qualification matches. This was the final World Cup in which the defending champions qualified automatically.

14 places were contested by [[UEFA]] teams (Europe), five by [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] teams (Africa), four by [[CONMEBOL]] teams (South America), four by [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] teams (Asia), and three by [[CONCACAF]] teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and UEFA and between CONMEBOL and [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] (Oceania). Four nations qualified for the finals for the first time: [[China national football team|China]], [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], and [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]. As of 2014, this was the last time [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], China, [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and Senegal qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals.

Turkey qualified for the first time since 1954, and both Poland and Portugal for the first time since 1986. 1998 semi-finalists the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] failed to qualify, while South Korea set a record by appearing in a fifth successive finals tournament, the first nation from outside Europe or the Americas to achieve this feat.

All seven previous World Cup-winning nations ([[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[England national football team|England]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]) qualified, the first time so many previous champions had been present at a finals tournament (all these nations had also appeared at the 1986 tournament, but France had not yet won the competition).

Before the draw, it was arranged that the last three teams in Pot B would be drawn into four groups which did not already contain two European teams and one would be left without a second European team. This was ultimately Group C.

On 1 December 2001, the draw was held and the group assignments and order of fixtures were determined. Group F was considered the [[group of death]], as it brought together Argentina, England, Nigeria and Sweden.

===Ranking criteria===

If teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:

{{quotation|
# Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches
# Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches
# If teams remained level after those criteria, a mini-group would be formed from those teams, who would be ranked on:
## Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie
## Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie
## Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie
# If teams remained level after all these criteria, FIFA would hold a drawing of lots
}}

In the original version of the rules for the final tournament, the ranking criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ar.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=4395/overview.html |title=كأس العالم كوريا/اليابان 2002 FIFA | date=June 2002 | work=[[FIFA]]}}</ref>

==Summary==

===First round===
Group A involved the defending champions [[France national football team|France]] take on [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. The World Cup started with a 1–0 defeat of France, playing without the injured [[Zinedine Zidane]], by tournament newcomers Senegal in the tournament's opening match held in [[Seoul World Cup Stadium|Seoul]], South Korea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/france_v_senegal/default.stm|title=Senegal stun France|date=31 May 2002|work=|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66UEZF93k|archivedate=27 March 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> On the next day, two goals by [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]] gave the Danes a 2–1 victory over Uruguay in [[Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium|Ulsan]].
In the second Group A matches, France were held to a 0–0 draw in [[Busan Asiad Stadium|Busan]] by Uruguay after star striker [[Thierry Henry]] was sent off, while in [[Daegu World Cup Stadium|Daegu]], Denmark and Senegal drew 1–1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/france_v_uruguay/newsid_1925000/1925345.stm|title=France face anxious wait|date=6 June 2002|work=|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66WvPnTV1|archivedate=29 March 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>
A 2–0 defeat by Denmark in their last group game in [[Incheon Munhak Stadium|Incheon]] sealed France's elimination in the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/we-got-what-we-deserved-says-dejected-vieira-645075.html|title=We got what we deserved, says dejected Vieira |date=12 June 2002|work=|publisher=Independent (UK)|accessdate=29 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66WvlSqAE|archivedate=29 March 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>
The world champions went out of the Cup without even managing to score a goal and earned the unwanted record of the worst World Cup performance by a defending champion (in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] Uruguay refused to defend the title).<ref>{{cite news

Senegal drew with Uruguay to clinch its place in the second round, despite Uruguay coming back from 3–0 down to draw with Senegal 3–3 in their last group game in [[Suwon World Cup Stadium|Suwon]], the South Americans couldn't find the fourth goal that would have kept them in the Cup and thus were out of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/senegal_v_uruguay/newsid_1926000/1926996.stm|title=Senegal cling on to qualify|date=11 June 2002|work=|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66UEpUWBD|archivedate=27 March 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> At the end, Denmark won Group A with 7 points, followed by Senegal with 5 points.

Japan would get their first ever World Cup victory a few days later in Yokohama, defeating Russia 1–0, thanks to a second-half goal by [[Junichi Inamoto]], while Belgium and Tunisia drew 1–1 in Ōita. In the final matches of Group H, Japan defeated Tunisia with ease, winning 0–2 in Osaka, while Belgium survived against Russia in Shizuoka, winning 3–2. Japan won Group H with seven points, while Belgium advanced with five points. Russia was eliminated with three points, and Tunisia was eliminated with one point.

=== Second Round and quarter-finals ===
In the second round, Germany beat Paraguay 1–0 with a late goal by [[Oliver Neuville]] in Seogwipo. England defeated Denmark in Niigata 3-0, with all goals occurring in the first half of the game. Sweden and Senegal faced off in Ōita and finished 1–1 in regular time and it took a [[golden goal]] from [[Henri Camara]] in extra time to settle the game for Senegal 1–2. Spain and Ireland played in Suwon, where Spain led most of the match 1–0 until a late penalty kick scored by Robbie Keane made the match go 1–1 sending it to extra time, where Spain outlasted Ireland 3–2 in a Penalty shootout. The United States beat CONCACAF rivals Mexico 2–0 in Jeonju, thanks to the goals of [[Brian McBride]] and [[Landon Donovan]]. Brazil defeated Belgium 2–0 in Kobe, with an amazing volley by [[Rivaldo]] and a splendid counter-attack goal by [[Ronaldo]]. Turkey ended co-hosts Japan's run with a 1–0 win in Miyagi, thanks to a [[Ümit Davala]] goal in the 12th minute. The other co-hosts, South Korea, defeated Italy 2–1 in extra time in Daejeon with a goal by [[Ahn Jung-hwan]] in the 117th minute, with many controversial decisions by the referee in favor of the Asian team.<ref name="goal.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2872/top-10/2010/05/24/1940343/top-10-worst-refereeing-decisions-in-world-cup-history|title=Top 10 worst refereeing decisions in World Cup history|accessdate=28 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HpGb0Lwu|archivedate=2 July 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> South Korea's win ensured that, for the very first time in the Cup's history, teams from each of Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia reached the quarter-finals of the same tournament.

In the quarter-finals, England and Brazil squared off in Shizuoka, where [[Ronaldinho]] scored a beautiful free-kick goal over England's [[David Seaman]] early in the second half as Brazil won 1–2. The United States lost to Germany 1–0 in Ulsan by a [[Michael Ballack]] goal in the 39th minute, but controversy surrounded the game when United States demanded the referee give a penalty for a goal-line handball by [[Torsten Frings]] in the 49th minute, but the referee did not award the penalty. South Korea got another win in Gwangju in a controversial manner, beating Spain 5–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in which the Spaniards twice thought they had scored while onside; however, the efforts were disallowed by the referee with controversial decisions.<ref name="goal.com"/> The hosts became the first team in the [[Asian Football Confederation]] to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, eclipsing the record of their [[North Korea national football team|North Korean counterparts]] who reached the quarter-finals in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. Turkey defeated Senegal 1–0 in Osaka, with a golden goal scored by [[İlhan Mansız]] in the 93rd minute.

===Semi-finals, third-place match, and final===
The semi-finals saw two 1–0 games; The first semi-final, held in Seoul saw a Michael Ballack goal good enough for Germany to defeat South Korea. However, Ballack received a yellow card during the match, which forced him to miss the final based on accumulated yellow cards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/news/2002/06/25/Ger_kor_gamer/|title=Ballack lifts Germany past co-host, into seventh Cup final|date=25 June 2002|work=|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=29 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66WyqmrLV|archivedate=29 March 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>
The next day in Saitama saw Ronaldo score a goal early in the second half, scoring his sixth of the competition for Brazil, who beat Turkey in a replay of their Group C encounter.<ref>{{cite news

In the third-place match in Daegu, Turkey beat the South Koreans 3–2, their first goal coming from [[Hakan Şükür]] straight from the opening kick-off (even though South Korea kicked off) in 10.8 seconds, the fastest ever goal in World Cup history.

In the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]] held in Yokohama, Japan, two goals from Ronaldo secured the World Cup for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] as they claimed victory over [[German national football team|Germany]]. Ronaldo scored twice in the second half and, after the game, won the [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Shoe]] award for the tournament's leading scorer with eight goals. This was the fifth time Brazil had won the World Cup, cementing their status as the most successful national team in the history of the competition. Brazil became the only team since Argentina in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] to win the trophy without needing to win a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] at some stage during the knockout phase, and the total number of penalty shootouts (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986. Brazil also became the first team to win every match at a World Cup Finals since 1970, and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner. Brazil's captain [[Cafu]], who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.

==Ticket sales problem==
The original domestic ticket allocation had fully sold out and the organising committee completed sales of tickets returned from the international allocation by the end of April. However, it was obvious at the opening matches that there were a significant number of empty seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/worldcup/06/01/probe.tickets/index.html |title=FIFA to probe empty seats |work=CNN.com |publisher=Cable News Network LP |date=1 June 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2013 |first=Andrew |last=Demaria}}</ref> It was gradually revealed that the World Cup Ticketing Bureau (WCTB) still had unsold tickets in its possession. After FIFA agreed to sell this inventory, JAWOC undertook sales over telephone and WCTB handled the internet sales.<ref>[http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/archives/wc2002/ne/espp.html Football News – Empty Seats, Peace and Passion], World Cup Soccer and Global Football Information – Soccerphile</ref> For the second round Japan vs. Turkey match in Miyagi in particular, although it was reported by both parties that all tickets had been sold, some 700 seats remained empty.

==Venues==
South Korea and Japan each provided 10 venues, the vast majority of them newly built for the tournament. Groups A-D played all their matches in South Korea, and Groups E-H played all their matches in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan – Report and Statistics |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/technicaldevp/50/08/41/fwc_korea_japan_2002_a_part1_265.pdf |work=FIFA.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |year=2002 |accessdate=25 October 2013 |pages=108–9 }}</ref>

[[Spain national football team|Spain]] won all three games to progress to the Round of 16, while [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] were eliminated with no points. [[Nelson Cuevas]]' second goal against Slovenia was enough to send [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] through by virtue of having scored more goals than [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].

[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] won all three games to progress, whilst [[China national football team|China PR]] were eliminated without a goal or a point.

{{Main|2002 FIFA World Cup Group D}}
[[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]'s shock 3–2 win over [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], together with a draw against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] was enough to send them through, even though they lost 1–3 against Poland. Portugal were eliminated with one win and two losses, including one against South Korea. [[Poland national football team|Poland]] were also eliminated, despite beating United States in their final game.

Like favourites [[France national football team|France]], second favourites [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] were eliminated following a 1–1 draw with [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in their third game. They needed a victory following their second game loss to [[England national football team|England]] to secure a second round berth. [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] topped the group, having scored more goals than England, while [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] had already been eliminated before drawing with England in their final match.

====Group G====
{{Main|2002 FIFA World Cup Group G}}
[[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] effectively qualified for the round of 16 after two wins in their first two games. [[Italy national football team|Italy]] also progressed thanks to [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]'s win over Croatia in Yokohama, and would have qualified even had [[Alessandro Del Piero]] not scored the equaliser against the Mexicans in the group's final match. This left [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] and World Cup debutants Ecuador, who picked up their maiden World Cup win against the Croats, eliminated from the World Cup with 3 points in 3rd and 4th respectively.
