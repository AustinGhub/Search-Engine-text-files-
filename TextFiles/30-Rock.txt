'''''30 Rock''''' is<!--Do not change this to "was"; we continue using "is" after a TV show concludes.--> an American [[satire|satirical]] television [[sitcom]] created by [[Tina Fey]] that ran on [[NBC]] from October 11, 2006 to January 31, 2013. The series, loosely based on Fey's experiences as head writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', takes place behind the scenes of a fictional live [[sketch comedy]] show depicted as airing on NBC.

Tonally, ''30 Rock'' uses [[surreal humor]] to parody the complex corporate structure of NBC and its then parent company [[General Electric]]. Television critic Todd VanDerWerff ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' once remarked that it 'usually adopts the manic pacing of a live-action cartoon.'<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van der Werff|first1=Todd|title=Live Show review|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/30-rock-live-show-46199|website=AV Club}}</ref> The show was influential in its extensive use of [[smash cut]]s: sudden, short cuts to unrelated scenes showing something the characters are briefly discussing. ''30 Rock'' also became known for its dedication to making these extremely elaborate, once showing a set that took three days to build for only six seconds of video.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wyatt|first1=Edward|title=Werewolf Bar Mitzvah|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/arts/television/25were.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>

''30 Rock'' received overwhelming critical acclaim throughout its entire run, winning several major awards (including [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|2007]], [[60th Primetime Emmy Awards|2008]], and [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards|2009]] and nominations for every other year it ran), and achieving the esteemed top ranking on myriad critics' year-end best of 2006-2013 lists.<ref name="nbcseriespress" /> On July 14, 2009, the series was nominated for 22 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most in a single year for a comedy series.<ref name="22_emmys">{{cite press release |title='30 Rock' leads Emmy nominations with 22 bids |work=USA Today |date=July 20, 2009 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/test/test2/2009-07-20-30RockTest2_N.htm |accessdate=August 10, 2009}}</ref> Over the course of the series, it was nominated for 103 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 16,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/30-rock |title=30 Rock |work=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|Television Academy]]}}</ref> in addition to numerous other nominations and wins from other awards shows.

==Development and production==

===Conception===
In 2002, Fey was the head writer and a performer on the television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). She pitched the show that became ''30 Rock'' to NBC, originally as a sitcom about [[cable television|cable]] [[news broadcasting|news]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hiatt|first1=Brian|title=The Last Days of '30 Rock'|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-last-days-of-30-rock-20130131|accessdate=17 August 2015|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=31 January 2013}}</ref> NBC Entertainment president [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]] felt that "Fey was using the news setting as a [[Fig leaf#Metaphorical use|fig leaf]] for her own experience and [he] encouraged her to write what she knew."<ref name="dev_1">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535853,00.html|title=Do Not Adjust Your Set|first=James |last=Poniewozik|accessdate=October 16, 2007|date=September 18, 2006|publisher=[[Time (magazine)]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071009001021/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535853,00.html| archivedate= October 9, 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an ''SNL''-style sketch show. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 2005–2006 television season. Just before the deal went through, however, the show was nearly brushed aside by Anthony Lewis and Jack Melcher, two NBC executives who fought the idea, fearing that Fey's removal from ''SNL'' would result in a severe cut to the show's ratings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Eventually, Lewis gave in just a month before his retirement, and Melcher backed down. In May 2003, Fey signed a contract with NBC to remain in her ''SNL'' head writer position until at least the 2004–2005 television season and to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal.<ref name="dev_2">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Schneider |title=Peacock updates ''SNL'' anchor's deal |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117885681.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=tina+fey+snl+2004%2D05 |work=Variety  |date=May 5, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Filming was postponed due to Tina Fey's first pregnancy.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoINgNgCx3Q Interview: Tina Fey], ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|Adam Carolla Show]]'', October 25, 2006.</ref>

During the 2004–2005 [[Television pilot#Pilot season|pilot season]], a pilot was announced named ''Untitled Tina Fey Project''. The ''30 Rock'' pilot focused on the boss of a variety show who has to manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both the stars as well as the show's new network executive.<ref name="dev_3">{{cite news |first=Josef |last=Adalian |author2=Schneider, Michael |title=Bruck finds ''Ring'' leader |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117917293.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |work=Variety  |date=February 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> ''30 Rock'' was officially given the green light to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.<ref name="greenlit13eps">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Goldman |title=Upfronts Announcement: NBC's Schedule for 2006–2007 Season |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/708/708855p2.html |publisher=IGN |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref>

The series underwent further changes during the months leading up to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from ''The Girlie Show'' would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, [[Dot Comedy|DotComedy.com]]. The idea was to air the fictitious ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' online.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Consoli |author2=Berman, Marc |title=NBC Upfront: Unveils DotComedy.com; ''Kidnapped'', ''Studio 60'' Set for Fall |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002502554 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612101404/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002502554 |archivedate=June 12, 2007 |publisher=Mediaweek |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> This aspect of the series was abandoned prior to its debut.

===Filming===
Inside scenes for ''30 Rock'' were mostly filmed at [[Silvercup Studios]] in Long Island City, Queens, NYC (Studio 8H in 30 Rock in Manhattan for two live episodes).<ref name="filminglocations" /> In the episodes "[[Cleveland (30 Rock)|Cleveland]]" and "[[Hiatus (30 Rock)|Hiatus]]," [[Battery Park City, Manhattan]] and [[Douglaston, Queens]] doubled for [[Cleveland]], Ohio and [[Needmore, Pennsylvania|Needmore]], Pennsylvania, respectively.<ref name="cleveneedmorelocations">{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Webb Mitovich |title=Funny Business: Tina Fey Previews 30 Rock's Future |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/funny-business-tina/070612-02 |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 14, 2007}}</ref> In the episode "Gavin Volure," [[stock footage]] of the [[Arkansas Governor's Mansion]] was used for exterior shots of the home of [[Steve Martin]]'s character.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Gambrell |title=Arkansas Governor's Mansion Has "30 Rock" Cameo |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/26/governors-mansion-has-30_n_146578.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref>

The title sequence is made up of photos and video of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and features the series regulars. The sequence ends with a [[Time-lapse photography|time lapse]] of the building and then a title card reading "30&nbsp;Rock". The sequence has remained mostly the same throughout the series, although there have been changes to the images of most of the actors.

===Music===
The series features a "jaunty" [[jazz]] [[Film score|score]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston//RecRoom/47984-Uncertain-Fey-t/ |title=Uncertain Fey-t |accessdate=June 6, 2008 |last=Miliard |first=Mike |date=September 25, 2007 |publisher=The Boston Phoenix}}</ref> Most of the [[incidental music]] melody is played by either [[clarinet]], [[bass clarinet]], [[saxophone]], or [[String instrument|strings]], often as wildly varying renditions of the usual central theme.

All are smiling broadly.|thumb|From left: Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan, Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy, Tina Fey as Liz Lemon, Jane Krakowski as Jenna Maroney and Jack McBrayer as Kenneth Parcell]] -->

The plot of ''30 Rock'' revolves around the cast and crew of the fictional [[sketch comedy]] series ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' (originally called ''The Girlie Show''), which is filmed in Studio 6H inside 30 Rockefeller Plaza.<ref name="plotreference" /> The series features an [[ensemble cast]].<ref name="nbcseriespress" /> The series features seven roles that receive star [[billing (film)|billing]] during the [[opening credits]]:
* [[Tina Fey]] as [[Liz Lemon]], the protagonist of the series, a "sexually-frightened know-it-all" and [[head writer]] of ''TGS with Tracy Jordan''.
* [[Tracy Morgan]] as [[Tracy Jordan]], the loose-cannon, crazy, unpredictable, star of ''TGS''.
* [[Jane Krakowski]] as [[Jenna Maroney]], original star of "The Girlie Show", co-star of ''TGS'' and Liz's constantly attention-seeking and clueless best friend.
* [[Jack McBrayer]] as [[Kenneth Parcell]], a cheerful, obedient [[Southern United States|Southern]]-born [[NBC page]], who "lives for television", and whose age is never verified but is hinted to be immortal.
* [[Scott Adsit]] as [[Pete Hornberger]], the "sane", quick-witted producer of ''TGS'', who often reveals embarrassing details about his family life.
* [[Judah Friedlander]] as [[Frank Rossitano]], a [[trucker hat]]-wearing, [[Puer aeternus|manchildish]], [[sarcastic]] writer at ''TGS''. His hat bears a different phrase in every episode.
* [[Alec Baldwin]] as [[Jack Donaghy]], the decisive, controlling, suave and occasionally senseless network executive who constantly interferes with the goings-on at ''TGS''.

Beginning with season two, three characters, who were credited as guest stars during season one, received star billing after the opening credits in addition to the principal cast:<ref name="nbcseriespress" />
* [[Katrina Bowden]] as [[Cerie Xerox|Cerie]], Liz's attractive, laid-back assistant, who usually wears revealing outfits to work, much to the delight of the writers' room.
* [[Keith Powell]] as [[James "Toofer" Spurlock]], the proud [[black people|black]] [[Harvard University]] alumnus writer, who often butts heads with Tracy and Frank.
* [[Lonny Ross]] as [[Josh Girard]], a young and immature ''TGS'' writer and co-star, known for his impressions. Ross was written out in season four.

Beginning with season three, three characters who were credited as guest stars in the first two seasons, received star billing after the opening credits in addition to Bowden, Powell, Ross, and the principal cast. They are credited only in the episodes in which they appear:
* [[Kevin Brown (actor)|Kevin Brown]] as [[Dot Com (30 Rock)|Dot Com]], an erudite member of Tracy's entourage who is also a [[Wesleyan University]]-trained stage actor. The character's real name is Walter Slattery.
* [[Grizz Chapman]] as [[Characters of 30 Rock#Grizz|Grizz]], a member of Tracy's entourage.
* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as [[List of recurring characters on 30 Rock#Jonathan|Jonathan]], Jack's loyal and overprotective personal assistant, who at times appears to be possibly in love with Jack. Pancholy left the show after season five and returned for season seven.

Beginning with season four, one character who was credited as a guest star in the first three seasons, received star billing after the opening credits in addition to Bowden, Powell, Brown, Chapman, and Pancholy.
* [[John Lutz]] as J.&nbsp;D. Lutz, a lazy, overweight ''TGS'' writer who is often insulted or made fun of by the rest of the staff.

===Additional characters===
* [[Dean Winters]] as Dennis Duffy, the irresponsible ex-boyfriend of Liz, who had guest appearances throughout the series.
* [[James Marsden]] as Criss Chros, Liz Lemon's boyfriend, who was often featured running a hot dog stand.

Tina Fey worked with Jen McNamara and [[Adam Bernstein]] for the casting of the series.<ref name="rockcasting">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Interview-Tina-Fey-Talks-About-30-Rock-Part-1-9723.html |title=Interview: Tina Fey Talks About ''30 Rock'' (Part 1) |accessdate=July 8, 2008 |author=West, Kelly|date=April 1, 2008 |publisher=Cinema Blend| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080625085840/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Interview-Tina-Fey-Talks-About-30-Rock-Part-1-9723.html| archivedate= June 25, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Fey's first act as [[casting director]] was to cast herself as the lead character, Liz Lemon, who is said to be much like Fey herself when she first became head writer on ''SNL''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/#mea=34901 |title='&#39;30 Rock'&#39; Exclusive Video Clips&nbsp;– NBC Official Site |publisher=Nbc.com |accessdate=April 12, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100322215649/http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/| archivedate= March 22, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The next actor to be cast was Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan,<ref name="dev_5">{{cite news |title=NBC comedy a reunion for Morgan, Fey |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001657605 |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=December 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> who was then a former castmate of Fey's in ''SNL''.

[[Rachel Dratch]], Fey's longtime comedy partner and fellow ''SNL'' alumna, was originally cast to portray Jenna. Dratch played the role in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement, with Dratch remaining involved in the show playing various characters.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-janekrakowskijoins30rock,0,1779072.story | title='Ally' Cat Krakowski Joins '30 Rock' | accessdate=October 16, 2007 | date=August 17, 2006 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref> Fey explained the change by noting that Dratch was "better-suited to playing a variety of eccentric side characters",<ref name="ctvhope">{{cite news| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061009/fey_tv_061009 |title=Fey hopeful about success of ''30 Rock''|author=Canadian Press |date=October 9, 2006 |accessdate=September 2, 2008 |publisher=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]]}}</ref> and that the role of Jenna was more of a straight-ahead acting part.

The show's cast and crew are outraged by this, especially head writer Liz Lemon and main actress Jenna Maroney. Jack proceeds to wreak havoc on ''The Girlie Show'', forcing Liz to hire off-the-wall movie star Tracy Jordan. He again irritates the cast and crew of ''The Girlie Show'' when he changes the name to ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' (or just ''TGS'').

As the season progresses, the episodes become less about ''TGS'' and more about how the characters deal with juggling their lives and their jobs&nbsp;—specifically the protagonist, Liz Lemon, but other characters are also explored. Episodes also become less self-contained and various story arcs develop in the second half of the season. For example, the first major story arc centers on Liz's relationship with [[Dennis Duffy]] ([[Dean Winters]]), "The [[Pager|Beeper]] King." Other story arcs include: Jenna promoting her movie ''[[The Rural Juror]]''; Tracy going on the run from the Black Crusaders; Jack's engagement, which was eventually called off, to a [[Christie's]] auctioneer named [[List of 30 Rock characters#Phoebe|Phoebe]] ([[Emily Mortimer]]); and another relationship of Liz's with [[List of 30 Rock characters#Floyd DeBarber|Floyd]] ([[Jason Sudeikis]]).

Guest stars include [[Nathan Lane]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Wayne Brady]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[Ghostface Killah]].

The later half of the season focused on two complementary story arcs: Jack's inability to choose between his two girlfriends, and Liz's inability to find a boyfriend to live up to her expectations and Jenna's relationship with a Jenna Maroney impersonator.

Season six finds Liz emotionally maturing while in a new relationship; Jack continues to attempt to recover his wife from [[North Korea]] and find his identity at Kabletown; Kenneth moves up (and later down,) the corporate ladder; and Jenna reaches a new level of fame thanks to being a judge on a reality show, and considers settling down with boyfriend Paul.

Season 7 continues to develop the relationship between Liz and Criss ([[James Marsden]]), as the pair try for children and consider getting married. Meanwhile, Jack attempts to improve his future prospects at the company, first by trying to "tank" [[NBC]] and convince Kabletown [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Hank Hooper ([[Ken Howard]]) to sell it, and later by plotting to discredit Hooper's granddaughter and future CEO, Kaylee Hooper ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]). Ultimately, however, he begins to wonder if he is truly happy. Elsewhere, Tracy has found success with his new movie studio, which produces comedy films mostly starring [[African American]] actors, in similar fashion to [[Tyler Perry]]; Jenna prepares to marry her longterm boyfriend Paul ([[Will Forte]]), and Kenneth has started a relationship with Hazel ([[Kristen Schaal]]), unaware that she is using him to get her moment on ''TGS''.

===Ratings===
Below, "Rank" refers to how well ''30 Rock'' rated compared to other television series which aired during primetime hours of the corresponding [[television season]]; for example, in its first year, there were 101 television series that were rated higher. The television season tends to begin in September of any given year and end during May of the following year. "Viewers" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes (broadcast in the series' "Regular Timeslot") of ''30 Rock'' aired during the television season. Although the viewer average may be higher for some seasons than others, the rank will not necessarily be higher. This is due to the number of programs aired during primetime. In some seasons there may be more regular programs aired during primetime than in others.

===Similarities to other media===
Two shows debuting on [[2006–07 United States network television schedule|2006–07 NBC lineup]], ''30 Rock'' and ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', revolved around the off-camera happenings on a ''Saturday Night Live''-analogue sketch comedy series. Similarities between the two led to speculation that only one of them would be picked up. Baldwin said "I'd be stunned if NBC picked up both shows. And ours has the tougher task, as a comedy, because if it's not funny, that's it."<ref name="newyorker">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_friend |title=Who's on First Dept: Shows about Shows |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |author=Friend, Tad |date=April 24, 2006|work=The New Yorker| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080911001913/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_friend| archivedate= September 11, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], then president of NBC Entertainment, was supportive of Fey, describing the situation as a "high-class problem":

Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when [[Aaron Sorkin]], the creator of ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'', asked [[Lorne Michaels]] to allow him to observe ''Saturday Night Live'' for a week, a request Michaels denied.<ref name="newyorker" /> Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with ''30 Rock''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/archives/105252.asp |title=Tina Fey's Weekend Update: Aaron Sorkin calls her out! |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |author=McFarland, Melanie |date=July 22, 2006|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5PqE41I68 | archivedate = June 24, 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref> Fey said that "it's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television.

Though ''30 Rock''{{'}}s first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of ''Studio 60'',<ref name="2006-07 primetime wrap" /> ''Studio 60'' was more expensive to produce.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/05012007/tv/studio_sinks__not_30_rock_tv_michael_starr.htm |title=''Studio'' Sinks, Not ''30 Rock'' |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |author=Starr, Michael |date=May 1, 2007 |work=New York Post}}</ref>

* "[[Jack Meets Dennis]]": Liz says the upcoming show will be "worse than that time we did that Gilbert and Sullivan parody". The second episode of ''Studio 60'', "The Cold Open," included a parody of the "[[Major-General's Song]]" on the show-within-the-show.
* "[[The Fabian Strategy]]": In the ending sequence Kenneth watches the credits for ''TGS'', which include [[Ricky Tahoe|Ricky]] and [[Ron Oswald|Ronnie]] as writers, the two ex-head writers on ''Studio 60''.
* "[[Plan B (30 Rock)|Plan B]]": [[Aaron Sorkin]] appears as himself as Liz is attempting to get a new job at NBC's ''[[The Sing-Off]]''. Sorkin explains to Liz that he, too, is having trouble finding work writing for television, despite having written such works as ''[[The West Wing]]'', ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', and ''[[The Social Network]]''.
