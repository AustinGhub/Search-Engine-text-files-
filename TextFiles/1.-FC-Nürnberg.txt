'''1. Fußball-Club Nürnberg Verein für Leibesübungen e. V.''', often called '''1. FC Nürnberg''' ({{IPA-de|ʔɛf ˈt͡seː ˈnʏʁnbɛʁk}}) or simply '''Nürnberg''', is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] in [[Nuremberg]], Bavaria, who currently compete in [[2. Bundesliga]]. Founded in 1900, the club initially competed in the [[Southern German football championship|Southern German championship]], winning their first title in 1916. Their first [[List of German football champions|German championship]] was won in 1920. Before the inauguration of the [[Bundesliga]] in 1963, 1.FCN won a further 11 regional championships, including the [[Oberliga Süd]] formed in 1945, and were German champions another seven times. The club has won the Bundesliga once and the [[DFB-Pokal]] four times.

Since 1963, the club have played their home games at the [[Frankenstadion]] in Nuremberg. Today's club has sections for boxing, handball, hockey, rollerblading and ice skating, swimming, skiing and tennis.

1. FCN have been relegated from the [[German football league system]] top tier [[Bundesliga]] on eight occasions&nbsp;– beating the record earlier set by [[Arminia Bielefeld]].<ref name=relegation>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/may/12/nurnberg.bundesligafootball | title=Nürnberg struggling to stay in the Bundesliga club | publisher=Guardian | date= 12 May 2008 | accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>

==History==
===Rise of "Der Club"===
[[Image:fcn1902.jpg|thumb|left|Team from 1902]]
[[Image:fcn-fcb1901.jpg|thumb|left|First match against [[FC Bayern Munich]] 1901]]
1. FC Nürnberg was founded on 4 May 1900 by a group of 18 young men who had gathered at local pub Burenhütte to assemble a side committed to playing football rather than [[rugby football|rugby]], one of the other new "English" games becoming popular at the time. By 1909, the team was playing well enough to lay claim to the South German championship. After World War I, Nürnberg would gradually turn their success into dominance of the country's football. In the period from July 1918 to February 1922, the team would go unbeaten in 104 official matches. As early as 1919, they came to be referred to simply as "''Der Club''" in recognition of their skill and of their style on and off the field, and would go on to become one of the nation's most widely recognized and popular teams.

Nürnberg faced [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth|SpVgg Fürth]] in the first national championship held after the end of World War I, beating the defending champions 2–0. That would be the first of five titles ''Der Club'' would capture over the course of eight years. In each of those wins, they would shutout their opponents.

The 1922 final was contested by Nürnberg and [[Hamburger SV]] but never reached a conclusion on the pitch. The match was called on account of darkness after three hours and ten minutes of play, drawn at 2–2. The re-match also went into extra time, and in an era that did not allow for substitutions, that game was called at 1–1 when Nürnberg was reduced to just seven players and the referee ruled [[Association football#Players, equipment and officials|incorrectly]] they could not continue. Considerable wrangling ensued over the decision. The [[German Football Association|DFB]] (Deutscher Fußball Bund or German Football Association) awarded the win to Hamburg, under the condition that they renounce the title in the name of "good sportsmanship"&nbsp;– which they grudgingly did. Ultimately, the Viktoria trophy was not officially presented that year.

===After the Glory years===
1. FCN's dominance was already beginning to fade when they captured their final trophy of the era in 1927 as the game began to evolve into a more quickly paced contest which did not suit their slower, more deliberate approach. While they continued to field strong sides, other clubs rose to the forefront of German football. In 1934, they lost in the final to [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], a club that would go on to become the strongest side in the era of football under the [[Third Reich]]. Nürnberg would capture national titles just before and after World War II in 1936 and 1948 in the first post-war national final, and would also take the Tschammerpokal, the forerunner of today's [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]], in 1935 and 1939.

===Into the Modern Era===
The post-war period began with the ''Club'' being integrated in the [[Oberliga Süd (1945–63)|Oberliga Süd]], one of the five top divisions in West-Germany at the time. Nürnberg managed to win this league six times until 1963, winning the national championship in 1948. In 1961, 1. FCN captured their eighth national title and appeared in a losing effort in the following year's final. Some consolation was to be had in the team capturing its second [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]] in 1962. Their strong play made them an obvious choice to be amongst the 16 teams selected to the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league, formed in 1963. ''Der Club'' played as a mid-table side through the league's early years until putting on a dominating performance in 1968 in which they sat atop the league table from the fifth week of play on to the end of the season, en route their first Bundesliga title. They went on to become the first club to be relegated from the Bundesliga as the reigning champions.<ref name=relegation /> This was a result of [[Max Merkel]]'s decision to remove his championship winning team of veterans, believing that they were too old, in favour of a dozen newcomers.

It would take the club nine years to recover and return from an exile in the second tier, first the [[Regionalliga Süd (1963–74)|Regionalliga Süd]], then the [[2. Bundesliga South (1974–81)|2. Bundesliga Süd]], that included several failed efforts in the promotion rounds. 1. FCN returned to the Bundesliga for a year in 1978, but played to a 17th-place finish and were relegated again. They immediately played their way back to the top flight, but since then their Bundesliga performances have been stumbling ones, characterized by finishes well down the league table and occasional relegation for a season or two. Their best recent result was a fifth-place finish in 1988.

The early 1980s also saw the rise of a longstanding and intense friendship between the fans of Nürnberg and those of former archrival Schalke 04. Fans accompany each other's on their respective away games, and the two season matches between the teams are generally a very laid-back and hospitable affair for all fans involved.

In the mid-1990s, Nürnberg had financial problems that led to their being penalized 6 points in the 1995–96 season while playing in the 2. Bundesliga. The club was relegated to the third division as a consequence. Improved management saw the club clawing back and return to the top flight eventually.

In 1999, however, 1. FCN suffered what was arguably the worst meltdown in Bundesliga history. Going into the last game of the season, they were in 12th place, three points and five goals ahead of [[Eintracht Frankfurt]], who were sitting in 16th place and seemingly headed to relegation. Nürnberg was closing out the season with what looked to be an easy home game against [[SC Freiburg]], who were also facing relegation. Frankfurt was up against [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]], last season's champions who were in a fight for a [[UEFA Champions League]] spot. Therefore, FCN had already begun soliciting season tickets for next Bundesliga season in a letter to current season ticket holders within celebrating successfully avoiding relegation.

The stage was set for an improbable outcome. Nürnberg lost 1–2 with [[Frank Baumann (footballer)|Frank Baumann]] missing a chance to score in the last minute. Every other 1. FCN rival won, including Frankfurt, who routed Kaiserslautern 5–1 with three late tallies&nbsp;– this put them ahead on goals scored and sent 1. FCN crashing to 16th place and into a shock relegation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E-cVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2RQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3861,6344408&dq=nuremberg+relegated&hl=en | title=Nuremberg are Relegated | publisher=New Straits Times | date=31 May 1999 | accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> 1. FCN was not relegated because they had fewer points than Frankfurt, nor because of a lower goal differential, but on the third tie-breaker&nbsp;– fewer goals scored.

1. FCN rebounded and played in the Bundesliga but still found themselves flirting with relegation from season to season. However, they had comfortably avoided relegation in the 2005–06 season, finishing eighth in the Bundesliga. After several years of consolidation, Nürnberg seemed back as a force to reckon with in Bundesliga football. Manager Martin Bader's professional and sometimes even spectacular work till spring 2007 (the signing of former [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] captain and Czech international [[Tomáš Galásek]], for example, was greeted with enthusiasm), as well head coach [[Hans Meyer (footballer)|Hans Meyer]]'s tactically modern understanding of football, helped Nürnberg to its most successful time in almost 40 years. In May 2007, the cut for the UEFA Cup was sure and after the triumph over Eintracht Frankfurt in the [[DFB-Pokal]], the ''Club'' was in the final of that tournament for the first time since 1982. On 26 May, the ''Club'' won this final against [[VfB Stuttgart]] in extra time 3–2, winning the DFB-Pokal again 45 years after the last victory. However, in the first round of 2007–08, the team could convince no more in Bundesliga. As the team had ended up second in [[UEFA Cup 2007–08#Group A]] in front of later champion [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] after defeating [[FC Rapid Bucureşti|Rapid Bucureşti]] in [[UEFA Cup 2007–08#First round]], head coach Hans Meyer was allowed to restructure the team, for example by buying Czech international striker [[Jan Koller]] from [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]]. In the consequence of no improvement, Meyer was replaced by [[Thomas von Heesen]] after two legs in second round. The latter one did not do much better, and so 1. FCN was relegated after finishing 16th after losing a 2–0 home match against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] on the final matchday. After not meeting the expectations of dominating the 2. Bundesliga, Von Heesen resigned in August and was replaced by his assistant coach, [[Michael Oenning]]. After a slow start, Oenning was able to guide Nürnberg to a third-place finish and a playoff with 16th placed [[FC Energie Cottbus|Energie Cottbus]]. Nürnberg won the playoff 5–0 on aggregate, rejoining the Bundesliga. They demoted again, however, after the [[2013–14 Bundesliga|2013–14 season]] after finishing 17th with a final matchday loss to Schalke 04. The club finished third in the 2015–16 season and qualified for the promotion play-off to the Bundesliga but lost on aggregate to [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and remained in the 2. Bundesliga.

==Rivals==
{{See also|Bavarian football derbies}}
The [[SpVgg Greuther Fürth]] is 1. FCN's longest standing local rival. Their rivalry goes back to the early days of German football when, at times, those two clubs dominated the national championship. The clubs have played 258 matches against each other, the most in German professional football. In 1921, the [[Germany national football team|German national team]] consisted only of players from Nürnberg and Fürth for a match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in [[Amsterdam]]. The players travelled in the same train, but with the Nürnberg players in a carriage at the front of the train and those from Fürth in a carriage at the rear, whilst the team manager [[Georg B. Blaschke]] sat in the middle. A Fürth player scored the first goal of the match, but was only congratulated by Fürth players. Allegedly, [[Hans Sutor]], a former SpVgg Fürth player, was forced to leave the team when he married a woman from [[Nuremberg]]. He was later signed by 1. FC Nürnberg and was in the team that eventually won three national championships.<ref>http://www.greuther-fuerth.de/v3/chronik/derby.php</ref> Both clubs played together in the Bundesliga in 2012–13.

Games against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] are usually the biggest events of the season, as the two clubs are the most successful in [[Bavaria]] and Germany overall.

==Reserve team==
{{Main|1. FC Nürnberg II}}
The ''1. FC Nürnberg II'' (or ''1. FC Nürnberg Amateure'') qualified for the [[Regionalliga Süd]] on the strength of a third place in the [[Bayernliga]] (IV) in 2007–08. The team had been playing in the Bayernlig since 1998, finishing runners-up three times in those years. When not playing in the Bayernlig, the team used to belong to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Mitte]]. Nowadays it plays in the tier four [[Regionalliga Bayern]].

==Honours==
''Der Club'' boasted the title of ''Deutscher Rekordmeister'' as holder of the most championships for over 60 years (although occasionally having to share the honour with [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]]) before being overtaken by [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in 1987.

Germany honours its Bundesliga champions by allowing them to display the [[Star (football badge)|gold stars]] of the "Verdiente Meistervereine"&nbsp;– one star for three titles, two stars for five and three stars for ten. However, currently only titles earned since 1963 in the Bundesliga are officially recognized. Despite winning the national title nine times, Nürnberg&nbsp;– the country's second-most successful side&nbsp;– is not entitled to sport any championship stars.

==Stadium==
{{details|Frankenstadion}}
[[Image:Frankenstadion.jpg|thumb|right|Frankenstadion August 2006]]
"Der Club" plays in the communally owned Frankenstadion (known as the Städtisches Stadion until 1990). It has been the club's home since 1963,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fcn.de/en/stadium/history/ | title=From "Municipal Stadium" to the easyCredit Stadium | accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> and currently has a capacity of 50,000 spectators following the stadium's most recent expansion during the winter break of the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|2009–10]] season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://gestern.nordbayern.de/artikel.asp?art=1157968&kat=31 | title=Nürnbergs neue Nordkurve ist fertig | language=German | date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> The club previously played its matches at the ''Zabo'' (an abbreviation of Zerzabelshof, the district in which the ground was located).

The stadium was built in 1928 and was known as Stadion der Hitler-Jugend from 1933 to 1945. Originally having a capacity of 40,000 spectators, it was expanded in 1965 to hold 65,000 and subsequently hosted the [[1967 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1967 Cup Winners' Cup final]] between [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], won 1–0 by the German side. The facility was refurbished for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] and another recently completed renovation allowed it to seat 45,000 for four preliminary round matches and one Round of 16 contest of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].

The Frankenstadion since 2012 bears the commercial name "Grundig Stadion" under an arrangement with a local company. The majority of the fans was in favour of renaming it after club legend Max Morlock.

The club is currently discussing the possibility of building a new stadium, which is to be completed by 2020. A feasibility study has been commissioned and contact has already been made with potential partners.<ref>http://www.stadionwelt.de/sw_stadien/index.php?head=Club-Neues-Stadion-bis-2020&folder=sites&site=news_detail&news_id=9298</ref> A new stadium is to be made a pure football stadium. It will be built on the site of Frankenstadion and hold a capacity of 50,000 spectators.<ref>http://www.nordbayern.de/nuernberger-nachrichten/nuernberg/club-will-2015-plane-fur-neue-arena-vorlegen-1.1596727</ref> However, the club has not yet announced any official plans for a new stadium.
