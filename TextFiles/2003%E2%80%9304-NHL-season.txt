The '''2003–04 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|87th]] [[regular season]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup champions]] were the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], who won the best of seven series four games to three against the [[Calgary Flames]].

For the fourth time in eight years, the all-time record for total shutouts in a season was shattered, as 192 shutouts were recorded.<ref name="hockey-reference.com">http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2004.html</ref> The 2003–04 regular season was also the first one (excluding the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season) since 1967–68 in which there was neither a 50-goal scorer, nor a 100-point scorer.<ref name="hockey-reference.com"/><ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1968.html</ref> This was the final season that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[ESPN]] televised NHL games. It was also the final NHL season before the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], and the final season in which games could end in ties.

==League business==
The schedule of 82 games was revamped. The 30 teams played 82 games in a revamped format that increased divisional games from five to six per team (24 total), conference games from three to four (40 total), and decreased inter-conference games to at least one per team, with three extra games (18 in total).

The alternating of jerseys was changed. For the first season since the [[1969–70 NHL season|1969–70 season]], teams would now wear their colored jerseys at home and white jerseys away.

The [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] moved to a [[Gila River Arena|new arena]] in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Arizona]], after playing their first seven seasons at [[Talking Stick Resort Arena|America West Arena]].

==Regular season==
The 2003–04 season was one overhung by concern over the expiry of the [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement]]. It would lead to the cancellation of the League's games for the entirety of the next season. During the entire season, [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]] and [[National Hockey League Players' Association|NHL Players' Association]] (NHLPA) head [[Bob Goodenow]] waged a war of words with no agreement being signed.

On September 26, just before the season was to begin, young [[Atlanta Thrashers]] star [[Dany Heatley]] crashed his [[Ferrari]] in suburban [[Atlanta]]. The passenger, Thrashers teammate [[Dan Snyder (ice hockey)|Dan Snyder]], was killed. Heatley himself was badly injured and eventually charged with [[vehicular homicide]].

Entering the season, the two Stanley Cup favorites were the [[Ottawa Senators]] in the Eastern Conference, who had won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] and come within a win of the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] the year before, and the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in the Western Conference, who, despite losing legendary [[goaltender]] [[Patrick Roy]] to retirement, added both [[Teemu Selänne|Teemu Selanne]] and [[Paul Kariya]] to an already star-studded lineup. Neither of these teams, however, were as successful as expected, with Ottawa finishing fifth in their conference and [[Colorado]] finishing fourth, losing the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]] title for the first time in a decade when the franchise was still known as the [[Quebec Nordiques]].

The greatest disappointments were the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]], who, despite making it to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals the year prior and adding both [[Sergei Fedorov]] and [[Václav Prospal|Vaclav Prospal]], failed to make the playoffs. The [[Los Angeles Kings]] failed to make the playoffs in large part due to a season-ending 11-game losing streak. In the East, the star-studded [[New York Rangers]] again failed to make the playoffs. The [[Washington Capitals]], who were regarded as a contender, also stumbled early in the season and never recovered. The end of the season saw two of the most extensive housecleanings in League history, as the Rangers and Capitals traded away many of their stars and entered "rebuilding mode." The Capitals traded away [[Jaromír Jágr|Jaromir Jagr]], [[Peter Bondra]], [[Sergei Gonchar]], [[Robert Lang (ice hockey)|Robert Lang]] and [[Anson Carter]], while the Rangers moved [[Petr Nedvěd|Petr Nedved]], [[Brian Leetch]], Anson Carter and [[Alexei Kovalev]] to other NHL teams.

The most surprising teams were the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in the East and the [[San Jose Sharks]] in the West. The Lightning, who had a remarkable season with only 20 man-games lost to injury, finished atop the Eastern Conference, while the Sharks, who were firmly in rebuilding mode after a disastrous 28–37–9–8 campaign the last season, came second in the West and won the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]].

Two other teams that did better than expected were carried by surprising young goaltenders. The [[Calgary Flames]] ended a seven-year playoff drought backed by the solid play of [[Miikka Kiprusoff]], and the [[Boston Bruins]] won the [[Northeast Division (NHL)|Northeast Division]] by a whisker over the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] with the help of eventual [[Calder Memorial Trophy]]-winning goaltender [[Andrew Raycroft]].

Goaltending was also the story of the Presidents' Trophy-winning [[Detroit Red Wings]] as the return from retirement of legend [[Dominik Hašek|Dominik Hasek]] bumped [[Curtis Joseph]] to the minor leagues. At the same time, long-time back up [[Manny Legace]] recorded better numbers than both veterans and won the starting job in the playoffs.

Of note is the fact that the [[Nashville Predators]] made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, though they were dispatched by a star-studded Detroit Red Wings team in the first round.

The regular season ended controversially, when in March 2004, the Vancouver Canucks' [[Todd Bertuzzi]] [[Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident|infamously attacked]] and severely injured the Colorado Avalanche's [[Steve Moore (ice hockey)|Steve Moore]], forcing the latter to eventually retire.

===Final standings===
''Detroit Red Wings won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] and home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs.''

For rankings in conference, division leaders are automatically ranked 1–3.  These three, plus the next five teams in the conference standings, earn playoff berths at the end of the season.

{{main|2004 Stanley Cup playoffs}}

The '''2004 playoffs''' were considered to be wide open, with no clear favorite. All of the top teams had weaknesses. Tampa Bay and Boston were both young teams with no history of recent postseason success. Detroit, Ottawa, Colorado, and Philadelphia all had major questions in goal. New Jersey was marred by injuries to [[Scott Stevens]] and [[Brian Rafalski]], while Vancouver was missing the suspended [[Todd Bertuzzi]].

The first-round Eastern Conference matchups were notable for the number of heated rivalries. The Ottawa Senators met the Toronto Maple Leafs for the fourth time in five years in the always passion-filled [[National Hockey League rivalries#Battle of Ontario|Battle of Ontario]]. The Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens met in a resumption of the [[List of most common NHL playoff series|most common of all NHL playoff series]], and one which the Canadiens have thoroughly dominated, including an upset win two years prior. The Philadelphia Flyers also played a hated division rival in the New Jersey Devils. The only non-rivalry was the Tampa Bay-[[New York Islanders]] series.

The West saw the resumption of the Vancouver-Calgary rivalry, which had been somewhat dormant as the Flames made the playoffs for the first time since [[1995–96 NHL season|1996]]. In a less passionate but still interesting matchup, Detroit played division rival Nashville (whom they had struggled against during the regular season) in Nashville's first ever franchise visit to the playoffs. San Jose met the St. Louis Blues, while the always difficult four-five matchup saw Colorado and Dallas meet.

The [[Calgary Flames]], a sixth seed, defeated the [[Vancouver Canucks|Canucks]], the [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]] and the [[San Jose Sharks|Sharks]] to become the first Canadian team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals in ten years, since the Canucks lost to the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] in {{scfy|1994}}. They faced the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], who defeated the [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] in five, swept the [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens]] and defeated the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]] in seven games.

===Stanley Cup Finals===
{{main|2004 Stanley Cup Finals}}
The Lightning beat the Flames in the Stanley Cup Finals, four games to three. With the Flames having a 3–2 series lead and the series going back to Calgary for Game 6, with the Stanley Cup in the building and with the game tied 2–2 in the third, [[Martin Gélinas|Martin Gelinas]] of the Flames (who scored the series-winning goals in the Flames' three previous series) appeared to have scored the go-ahead goal. Gelinas redirected a pass towards the Tampa net using his skate that was kicked out by Lightning goaltender [[Nikolai Khabibulin]]. It appeared that before Khabibulin kicked the puck out, it had already crossed the goal line.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBBgCRIxrtg&feature=related</ref> The play was not reviewed. To this day, many Flames fans argue that the puck was in.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The game eventually went into double overtime, where Lightning winger and former Flame [[Martin St. Louis]] scored the overtime winner. The Lightning went on to win Game 7 by a score of 2–1 and captured their first championship in franchise history. [[Brad Richards]], with 12 goals and 26 points in the playoffs, won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as playoff MVP.
