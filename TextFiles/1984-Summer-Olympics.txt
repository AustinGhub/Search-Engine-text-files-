The '''1984 Summer Olympics''', officially known as the '''Games of the XXIII Olympiad''', was an international [[multi-sport event]] held in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]] in 1984. When [[Tehran]], the only other interested city on the international level, declined to bid due to the concurrent Iranian political and social changes, the [[IOC]] awarded Los Angeles the Games by default.  This was the second occasion Los Angeles hosted the games; it previously hosted in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]].

In response to the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, 14 [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, including the [[Soviet Union]], [[Cuba]] and [[East Germany]], [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted the Games]]; only [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] elected to attend. For differing reasons, [[Iran]] and [[Libya]] also boycotted. The USSR announced its intention not to participate on May 8, 1984, citing security concerns and "chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States."<ref>{{cite news|last=Burns|first=John F.|title=Protests are Issue: Russians Charge 'Gross Flouting' of the Ideals of the Competition|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=May 9, 1984}}</ref> Boycotting countries organized another large event in June–September 1984, called the [[Friendship Games]]; however, not even a single competition was held between July 28 and August 12. Representatives of the organizing countries, the Soviets in particular, underlined it was "not held to replace the Olympics". Elite athletes from the U.S. and USSR would only compete against each other at the [[1986 Goodwill Games]] in Moscow, organized in response to the boycotts.

Where ambitious construction for the 1976 games in Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organizers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by [[Peter Ueberroth]] used some of the profits to endow the [[LA84 Foundation]] to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics.<ref name="financiallySuccessful">{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/86729520.html?dids=86729520:86729520&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+28%2C+2001&author=ALAN+ABRAHAMSON&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=L.A.+the+Best+Site%2C+Bid+Group+Insists%3B+Olympics%3A+Despite+USOC+rejection%2C+officials+say+their+plan+was+in+line+with+IOC%27s+call+for+downsizing+of+Games.&pqatl=google|title=LA the Best Site, Bid Group Insists; Olympics: Despite USOC rejection|date=July 25, 2004|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 17, 2008 | first=Alan | last=Abrahamson}}</ref>

The host state of California was the home state of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], who officially opened the Games. He had served as [[Governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975. The official mascot of the Los Angeles Games was [[Sam (Olympic Mascot)|Sam the Olympic Eagle]]. The logo of the games featured five blue, white and red stars arranged horizontally and struck through with alternating streaks; it was named "Stars in Motion." These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch .

On July 18, 2009, a 25th anniversary celebration was held in the main stadium. This celebration included a speech by the former president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, Peter Ueberroth, and a re-creation of the lighting of the cauldron.

==Host selection==
The selection process for the 1984 Summer Olympics consisted of a single finalized bid, with the [[International Olympic Committee]] accepting the bid of Los Angeles. A bid from Tehran was withdrawn before the selection. Los Angeles had unsuccessfully bid for the two previous Summer Olympics, for 1976 and 1980. The [[United States Olympic Committee]] had at least one bid for every Olympics since [[1944 Summer Olympics|1944]], but had not succeeded since the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Olympics in 1932]], the previous time a single bid had been issued for the Summer Olympics.<ref name=votes>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref>

==Torch relay==
{{main|1984 Summer Olympics torch relay}}
The 1984 Olympic Torch Relay began in New York City and ended in Los Angeles, traversing 33 states and the District of Columbia. Unlike later torch relays, the torch was continuously carried by runners on foot. The route covered more than 9,320&nbsp;mi (15,000&nbsp;km) and involved 3,636 runners, including 200 from the sponsoring company [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]. Noted athlete [[O.J. Simpson]] was among the runners, carrying the torch up the [[California Incline]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].
Gina Hemphill, granddaughter of Jesse Owens, carried the torch into the Coliseum, completed a lap around the track, then handed it off to the final runner,
[[Rafer Johnson]], winner of the [[decathlon]] at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. With the torch, he touched off the flame which passed through a specially designed flammable Olympic logo, igniting all five rings. The flame then passed up to cauldron atop the peristyle and remained aflame for the duration of the Games.

==Music==
[[John Williams (composer)|John Williams]] composed the theme for the Olympiad, "[[Olympic Fanfare and Theme]]". This piece won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for Williams and became one of the most well-known musical themes of the Olympic Games, along with [[Leo Arnaud]]'s "[[Bugler's Dream]]"; the latter is sometimes attached to the beginning of Olympic Fanfare and Theme. Composer [[Bill Conti]] also wrote a song to inspire the weightlifters called "Power". An album, ''The Official Music of the XXIII Olympiad—Los Angeles 1984'', featured three of those tracks along with sports themes written for the occasion by popular musical artists including [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Loverboy (band)|Loverboy]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Various – The Official Music Of The XXIIIrd Olympiad – Los Angeles 1984 (LP) at Discogs <!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE -->|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Official-Music-Of-The-XXIIIrd-Olympiad-Los-Angeles-1984/release/694895|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jjoXX5GI|archivedate=September 12, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}</ref> The album was released on [[Columbia Records]] and the catalogue number was BJS 39322.

The Brazilian composer [[Sérgio Mendes]] also composed a special song for the 1984 Olympic Games, "Olympia," from his 1984 album ''[[Confetti (Sérgio Mendes album)|Confetti]]''. A [[choir]] of approximately one thousand voices was assembled of [[singer (music)|singers]] in the region. All were volunteers from nearby [[Church body|churches]], schools and universities.

[[Etta James]] performed "[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]" at the Opening Ceremony.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glAu9xxlMJ8&list=PLiFG--hp3gpW60VYhtj8L7nkAe8FjPqH7|title=Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Opening Ceremony Complete|author=|date=September 6, 2014|work=YouTube|trans-title=Go to time stamp 29:40 for Etta James' performance. A previously cited Associated Press story (in which James was credited for singing the national anthem) was an AP reporting error. The national anthem was performed by a choir, and James appeared to perform 'When The Saints Go Marching In' later in the ceremony.}}</ref>

Vicki McClure along with the International Children's Choir of Long Beach sang "[[Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)|Reach Out and Touch]]".

[[Lionel Richie]] performed a 9-minute version of his hit single "[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]]" at the closing ceremonies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Malone |first=MacKenzie |title=Tuning into the Games, Watching the Olympics is the next best thing to playing |url=http://www.timesunion.com/entertainment/article/Tuning-into-the-Games-3720777.php |accessdate=April 4, 2014 |work=Times Union |date=July 19, 2012}}</ref>

==Highlights==

===Arts Festival<!--[[Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival]] redirects directly here.-->===
The 1984 Summer Olympics was preceded by the 10-week-long adjunct Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival, which opened on June 2 and ended on August 12. It provided more than 400 performances by 146 theater, dance and music companies, representing every continent and 18 countries. It was organized by then-[[CalArts]] President [[Robert Fitzpatrick (art executive)|Robert Fitzpatrick]].

===General===
* The opening ceremony featured the arrival of Bill Suitor by means of the [[Bell Aerosystems]] [[rocket pack]] (also known as a Jet Pack).
* The [[United States Army Band]] formed the Olympic rings, waiting to start the opening ceremony.
* As a result of an IOC agreement designating the Republic of China (Taiwan) [[Chinese Taipei]], the People's Republic of China returned to the summer Olympics for the first time since [[Helsinki 1952]] and won 15 gold medals. In weightlifting, athletes from the Chinese Taipei and China teams won medals at the same event.
* Eleven athletes failed drug tests at the Los Angeles Games.
* Local Los Angeles artist [[Rodolfo Escalera]] was commissioned to create nine paintings depicting the summer games that would later be turned into collectible plates and presented as "The Official Gift of the 1984 Olympics".

===Track and field===
* [[Carl Lewis]], making his first of four appearances at the Olympics, equaled the 1936 performance of [[Jesse Owens]] by winning four gold medals, in the 100 m, 200 m, 4 × 100 m relay and long jump.
* Eighteen-year-old [[Zola Budd]], a South African runner given British citizenship in order to dodge the [[apartheid]]-based ban on South African competitors, collided with home favourite [[Mary Decker|Mary Decker-Slaney]] in the final of the 3000 m, causing the American to fall. With the crowd booing her for the rest of the race, Budd dropped back and finished well down the order. She was later cleared of wrongdoing and was also declared not culpable by Decker-Slaney. While the Decker-Budd duel was highly sensationalized, the race itself was won by [[Maricica Puica]] of Romania, one of that era's most successful middle distance runners, whose accomplishment was diminished by the controversy. 
* [[Edwin Moses]] won the gold medal in the 400m hurdles 8 years after winning in 1976.
* [[Joaquim Cruz]] won the 800 meter run with a time of 1:43.00 to set an Olympic record.
* [[Nawal El Moutawakel]] of Morocco became the first female Olympic champion of a Muslim nation—and the first of her country—in the 400 m hurdles.
* [[Carlos Lopes]], from Portugal, won the [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's marathon|Marathon]] with a time of 2:09:21, an Olympic record that stood for 24 years. It was the first gold medal ever for Portugal. Gold medal favourite, World Record holder and the then World Champion, [[Robert de Castella]] from [[Australia at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Australia]], finished in 5th place, 1:48 behind Lopes.
* A [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] for women was held for the first time at the Olympics (won by [[Joan Benoit]]). The event was considered notable because of Swiss runner [[Gabriela Andersen-Schiess|Gabi Andersen-Schiess]], who – suffering from heat exhaustion – stumbled through the last lap, providing dramatic images.
*[[Daley Thompson]] apparently missed a new world record in winning his second consecutive gold medal in the [[decathlon]]; the next year his score was retroactively raised to 8847, giving him the record.
*[[Sebastian Coe]] became the first man to win consecutive gold medals in the [[1500m]].

===Other sports===
*The first gold medal to be awarded at the Los Angeles Olympics was also the first-ever medal to be won by an athlete from China when [[Xu Haifeng]] won the [[50 m Pistol]] event.
*[[Archery at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Archer]] [[Neroli Fairhall]] from New Zealand was the first [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] Olympian at any Olympic Games, coming 35th in the Women's individual event.
*[[Synchronized swimming]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]] debuted in Los Angeles as Olympic events, as did [[wind surfing]].
*[[Li Ning]] from the People's Republic of China won 6 medals in gymnastics, 3 gold, 2 silver, and 1 bronze, earning him the nickname "Prince of Gymnasts" in China. Li would later light the Olympic Cauldron at the [[2008 Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSSP4750620080808 Reuters – ''Li Ning, "Prince of Gymnasts" and businessman'' – Aug 8, 2008]</ref>
*[[Steve Redgrave]] won his first title in [[Sport rowing|rowing]] of the record five he would go on to win in five Olympic competitions.
*[[Victor Davis]] set a new world record in winning the gold medal in the 200-metre breaststroke in swimming.
*[[Mary Lou Retton]] became the first gymnast outside Eastern Europe to win the gymnastics all-around competition.
* In men's gymnastics, the American team won the Gold Medal.
* [[France national football team|France]] won the Olympic football tournament, defeating Brazil 2–0 in the final. Olympic football was unexpectedly played before massive crowds throughout America, with several sell-outs at the 100,000+ seat [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. This interest eventually led to the US hosting the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].
* The Soviet-led boycott affected weightlifting more than any other sport: 94 of the world's top 100 ranked lifters were absent, as were 29 of the 30 medalists from the recent world championships. All 10 of the defending world champions in the 10 weight categories were absent.
* Future [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]] members [[Michael Jordan]], [[Patrick Ewing]], and [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] were on the team that won the gold medal in [[basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|basketball]]. The [[1984 United States men's Olympic basketball team|1984 US men's Olympic basketball team]] was coached by [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]] head coach [[Bob Knight|Bobby Knight]].
*[[Connie Carpenter-Phinney]] became the first woman to win an Olympic cycling event when she won the [[Cycling at the 1984 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race|women's individual road race]].

==Post Closing Ceremony Fanfare==
*Featured powerful trumpet and choral music as [[Richard Basehart]] lent his voice to a rousing monologue.
*Thus Spake Zarathustra blared as a 52-foot diameter scale model UFO appeared and then communicated via sound and light.
*Next, a 7'8" tall man dressed in gray alien costume emerged and saluted humanity's efforts.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wolper |first=Davide|title=Out of the sky, some Hollywood magic |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/12/sports/sp-wolper-olympics12 |accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=LA Times|date=August 12, 2009}}</ref>

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
[[File:1984 Summer Olympic games countries.png|thumb|Participating nations]]
[[File:1984 Summer olympics team numbers.gif|thumb|Number of athletes]]
Athletes from 140 nations competed at the Los Angeles Games. The following countries made their first Olympic appearance in 1984: Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, [[British Virgin Islands]], Djibouti, [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gambia]], Grenada, Mauritania, Mauritius, [[North Yemen]], Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and the United Arab Emirates. Zaire had competed previously as ''Congo Kinshasa''. The [[People's Republic of China]] made their first appearance in a Summer Olympics since 1952, while for the first time the [[Republic of China]] team participated under the politically made-up name as ''[[Chinese Taipei]]''.

The [[Soviet Union]] led the [[Warsaw Pact]] and other Communist and Socialist countries on a boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics, in retaliation for the U.S.-led boycott of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow over the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. However, a handful of Socialist countries disregarded the boycott and attended anyway. Among them were [[Yugoslavia]] (which hosted the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]), the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Communist Romania|Romania]]. The fact that Romania, a Warsaw Pact country, opted to compete despite Soviet demands led to a warm reception of the Romanian team by the United States. When the Romanian athletes entered during the opening ceremonies, they received a standing ovation from the spectators, which comprised mostly U.S. citizens. Romania won 53 medals, including 20 golds, more than the nation has in any other Olympics.

The number of athletes representing that nation is shown in parentheses:

==Los Angeles as host city==
[[File:1984-Newspaper-Vending-Machine.jpg|thumb|Newspaper vending machine bringing news of the 1984 Summer Olympics.]]
Following the news of the massive financial losses of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal, Quebec, Canada]], only Los Angeles and New York City expressed serious interest in hosting the 1984 games. Given only one city per country is allowed to bid for any Games, the [[United States Olympic Committee|USOC]] vote for an American bid city was essentially the deciding vote for the 1984 Olympics host city. In this case, Los Angeles's bid won by a vote of 55 to 39. New York City's 1984 bid fell 16 votes shy of winning the Games and is the closest the city has ever come to becoming a host city for the Olympics, coming even closer than they did in their [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 bid]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Books/No_Olympics_No_Problem.pdf No Olympics No Problem] by Andrew H. Levin. April 27, 2007. page 27. Accessed July 24, 2009. [http://www.webcitation.org/5iZFezsEu Archived] July 26, 2009.</ref>

Los Angeles is the only US city to host the Summer Olympics twice.

The low level of interest among cities was seen as a major threat to the future of the Olympic Games. However, with the financially successful Los Angeles Games, cities began to line up to be hosts again. The Los Angeles and Montreal Games are seen as examples of what to do and what not to do when organizing the Olympics, and serve as object lessons to prospective host cities. Montreal organizers had run up a substantial debt eight years earlier by constructing many new, overly ambitiously designed venues, but as the only bidding city the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee was able to extract concessions from the IOC: namely, that the city would not be responsible for any cost overruns and that it could use area venues that were already in existence, particularly [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], which was also the Olympic Stadium for the [[1932 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Let Boston 2024 pay for the Olympics - The Boston Globe|url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/10/09/private-group-wants-olympics-boston-let-them-pay-for/Lhszp3SJirPrwAsrfpWz5J/story.html|accessdate = July 28, 2015}}</ref> The Olympic Velodrome and the Olympic Swim Stadium, funded largely by the [[7-Eleven]] and [[McDonald's]] corporations respectively, were the only two new venues constructed specifically for the L.A. Games. The resulting low construction costs, coupled with a heavy reliance on private corporate funding, allowed the Games to generate a profit of more than $200&nbsp;million, making them by far the most financially successful in history.<ref name="financiallySuccessful" />

In addition to corporate support, the Olympic committee also made use of the burgeoning prices being paid for exclusive television rights. Starting with the Los Angeles Games, these contracts would be a significant source of revenue. Adjusted for inflation, the Los Angeles Games received twice the amount received by the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Moscow Summer Olympics]] and four times that of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Summer Olympics]].<ref>Shoval, Noam. "A New Phase in the Competition For The Olympic Gold: The
London and New York Bids For The 2012 Games." Journal of Urban Affairs

==In popular culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2014}}
[[McDonald's]] ran a promotion entitled "When the U.S. Wins, You Win" where customers scratched off a ticket with the name of an Olympic event on it, and if the U.S. won that event then they would be given a free menu item: a [[Big Mac]] for a gold medal, an order of [[french fries]] for a silver medal, and a [[Coca-Cola]] for a bronze medal. The promotion became a near financial disaster due to the Soviet boycott which led to the U.S. winning far more Olympic medals than expected.<ref name="wins-you-win">{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B13FA3F5C0C738DDDA10894DC484D81&n=Top/News/Business/Companies/McDonald's%20Corporation | work=The New York Times | date=August 10, 1984 | accessdate=April 20, 2010 | title=Advertising; Big Mac's Olympic Giveaway | first=Pamela G. | last=Hollie}}</ref>

This promotion was parodied in the ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Lisa's First Word]]", where [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty Burger]] runs a similar offer. The promotion was intended to be rigged so that prizes would only be offered in events dominated by the [[Eastern Bloc]], but the Soviet-led boycott causes Krusty to personally lose $44 million. He vehemently promises "to spit in every fiftieth burger," to which [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] retorts "I like those odds!" [[Chief Wiggum]] also exclaims that he could kiss [[Carl Lewis]], who won four gold medals at the Games.

On ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', Tim McGee has an obsession with jet packs, stemming from having attended the 1984 Olympic ceremony as a child and having Bill Suitor fly over his head in his jet pack.<ref>{{Cite episode|title = Ignition|series= NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service | serieslink = NCIS (TV series)| network = CBS| airdate =January 5, 2010 | season = 7|number = 11| minutes= 43}}</ref> This storyline is based on the real experience of executive producer and writer Jesse Stern.<ref>{{Cite video|people = Stern, Jesse| title = The Future is Now: NCIS meets the jet pack| medium = NCIS: The Seventh Season (Disc 3 special features)| publisher=CBS Studios}}</ref>

Pop punk band [[Bowling For Soup]] references the games in the song "[[Sorry for Partyin'|I Can't Stand LA]]". During a section showing appreciation for the city, the song states, "thank you for hair metal and the '84 Olympics."

[[Jilly Cooper]]'s novel Riders has a storyline set at the show jumping event in the 1984 LA Olympics.

Computer company [[Apple Inc]] made an advertisement tying its product [[Macintosh]] into the 1984 Olympics javelin throwing competition and the novel [[1984 (novel)|1984 ]]. The commercial features a javelin thrower hurling a javelin at a telescreen of [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]], destroying it.
