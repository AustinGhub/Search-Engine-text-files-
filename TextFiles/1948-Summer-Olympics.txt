{{1948 Summer Olympics}}
The '''1948 Summer Olympics''', officially known as the '''Games of the XIV Olympiad''', were an international [[multi-sport event]] which was held in [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. After a 12-year hiatus because of [[World War II]], these were the first Summer Olympics since the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]] in Berlin. The 1940 Games had been scheduled for [[Tokyo]], and then for [[Helsinki]]; the 1944 Games had been provisionally planned for London. This was the second occasion that London had hosted the Olympic Games, having previously been the venue in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]]. The Olympics again returned to London in [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]], making it thus far the only city to host the games three times. These were the first of two summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of [[Sigfrid Edström]].

The event came to be known as the Austerity Games, because of the economic climate and post-war rationing. No new venues were built for the games, and athletes were housed in existing accommodation instead of an [[Olympic Village]] as were the 1936 Games and the subsequent [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Games]]. A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men and 390 women, in 19 [[Olympic Sports|sport disciplines]]. Germany and Japan were refused permission to participate; the USSR was invited but chose not to send any athletes. The United States team won the most total medals, 84, and the most gold medals, 38. The [[Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics|host nation]] won 23 medals, three of them gold.

One of the star performers at the Games was Dutch sprinter [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]]. Dubbed "The Flying Housewife", the 30-year-old mother of two won four gold medals in athletics. In the [[decathlon]], American [[Bob Mathias]] became the youngest male ever to win an Olympic gold medal at the age of 17. The most individual medals were won by [[Veikko Huhtanen]] of Finland who took three golds, a silver and a bronze in men's gymnastics.

==Election as host city==

In June 1939, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) awarded the [[1944 Summer Olympics|1944 Olympic Summer Games]] to London, ahead of [[Rome]], [[Detroit]], [[Budapest]], [[Lausanne]], [[Helsinki]], [[Montreal]] and [[Athens]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/past.html |title=Past Olympic Host City Election Results |publisher=gamesbids.com |accessdate=29 April 2010| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hgGWbUj1 | archivedate = 20 June 2009| deadurl=no}}</ref> World War II stopped the plans and the Games were cancelled so London again stood as a candidate for 1948. Britain almost handed the 1948 games to the USA due to post-war financial and rationing problems, but [[George VI]] said that this could be the chance to restore Britain from [[World War II]]. The official report of the London Olympics shows that there was no case of London being pressed to run the Games against its will. It says:

:The Games of 1944 had been allocated to London and so it was that in October 1945, the chairman of the [[British Olympic Council]], [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], went to [[Stockholm]] and saw the president of the International Olympic Committee to discuss the question of London being chosen for this great event. As a result, an investigating committee was set up by the British Olympic Council to work out in some detail the possibility of holding the Games. After several meetings they recommended to the council that the [[Lord Mayor of London]] should be invited to apply for the allocation of the Games in 1948.<ref>Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948(1951), pp. 17</ref>

In March 1946 the IOC, through a postal vote, gave the summer Games to London and the winter competition to [[St Moritz]]. London was selected ahead of [[Baltimore]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Lausanne]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1364.pdf |title=Olympic Games Fonds |publisher=International Olympic Committee Historical Archives |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>

London, which had previously hosted the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], became the second city to host the Olympics twice; Paris hosted the event in 1900 and 1924. It became the first city to host the Olympics for the third time when London hosted the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

==Organization==
[[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a gold medal winner at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics]], member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), and President of the [[Amateur Athletics Association]] was named Chairman of the Organising and Executive Committees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/29/30/article212013029.shtml |title=David George Burghley – lord of the hurdles (photos attached) |accessdate=27 April 2010 |publisher=The official website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games}}</ref> The other members of the committees were: Colonel Evan Hunter, General Secretary of the [[British Olympic Association]], and [[Head of Mission|Chef de mission]] for Great Britain; [[Clarence Bruce, 3rd Baron Aberdare|Lord Aberdare]], the other British member of the IOC; Sir Noel Curtis-Bennett;  Alderman H.E. Fern; E.J. Holt; J. Emrys Lloyd, who became the committee's legal advisor; C.B. Cowley of the London Press and Advertising; R.B. Studdert, Managing Director of the Army & Navy Stores; [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|A.E. Porritt]], a member of the IOC for New Zealand who resided in London; [[Stanley Rous|S.F. Rous]], Secretary of [[The Football Association]]; and [[Jack Beresford]].<ref>Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948(1951), pp. 18</ref>

Olympic [[pictogram]]s were introduced for the first time. There were twenty of them—one for each Olympic sport and three separate pictograms for the arts competition, the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. They were called "Olympic symbols" and intended for the use on tickets. The background of each pictogram resembled an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]].<ref>Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948(1951), pp. 131, 135</ref><ref>[http://en.beijing2008.cn/tickets/samples/n214074036.shtml Two sample tickets from 1948 Summer Olympics] at the Official Website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games</ref> Olympic pictograms would appear again 16 years later and be featured at each Summer Olympics thereafter.

At the time of the Games food, petrol and building rationing was still in place in Britain; because of this the 1948 Olympics came to be known as the "[[Austerity|Austerity Games]]".<ref name="British Olympic Movement"/> Athletes were given increased rations, the same as those received by dockers and miners, which meant 5,467 calories a day, instead of the normal 2,600. Building an [[Olympic Village]] was deemed too expensive; athletes were therefore housed in existing accommodation. Male competitors stayed at [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] camps in [[RAF Uxbridge|Uxbridge]] and [[RAF West Drayton|West Drayton]], and an Army camp in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]; female competitors in London colleges.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/1948-olympics-we-had-much-more-fun-and-a-greater-sense-of-achievement-than-modern-athletes-do-497866.html |title=1948 Olympics: 'We had much more fun and a greater sense of achievement than modern athletes do' |work=The Independent |author=Mike Rowbotham |date=7 July 2005 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>

These were the first games to be held following the death of [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], in 1937. They were also the last to feature an [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|arts competition]], which took place at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref name="BOA 1948">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=s&ga=12 |title=London 1948 |publisher=British Olympic Association |accessdate=26 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408081536/http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=s&ga=12 |archivedate = 8 April 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

==Opening ceremony==
[[File:The XIV Olympic Games opens in London, 1948..jpg|thumb|250px|The XIV Olympic Games opens in London, 1948]]
The Games opened on 29 July. Army bands began playing at 2 pm for the 85,000 spectators in [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The international and national organisers arrived at 2.35&nbsp;pm and [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], with [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and other members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], at 2.45&nbsp;pm. Fifteen minutes later the competitors entered the stadium in a procession that took 50&nbsp;minutes. The last team was that of the United Kingdom. When it had passed the saluting base, Lord Burghley began his welcome:

:Your Majesty: The hour has struck. A visionary dream has today become a glorious reality. At the end of the worldwide struggle in 1945, many institutions and associations were found to have withered and only the strongest had survived. How, many wondered, had the great Olympic Movement prospered?

After welcoming the athletes to two weeks of "keen but friendly rivalry", he said London represented a "warm flame of hope for a better understanding in the world which has burned so low."<ref>Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948(1951), pp. 221</ref>

At 4&nbsp;pm, the time shown on [[Big Ben]] on the London Games symbol, the King declared the Games open, 2,500 pigeons were set free and the Olympic Flag raised to its {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on}} flagpole at the end of the stadium. The [[Royal Horse Artillery]] sounded a 21-gun salute and the last runner in the Torch Relay ran a lap of the track – created with cinders from the domestic coal fires of [[Leicester]] – and climbed the steps to the Olympic cauldron. After saluting the crowd, he turned and lit the flame. After more speeches, [[Don Finlay|Donald Finlay]] of the British team (given his [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] rank of [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]) took the [[Olympic Oath]] on behalf of all competitors. The National Anthem was sung and the massed athletes turned and marched out of the stadium, led by Greece, tailed by Britain.

The 580-page official report concluded:

:Thus were launched the Olympic Games of London, under the most happy auspices. The smooth-running Ceremony, which profoundly moved not only all who saw it but also the millions who were listening-in on the radio throughout the world, and the glorious weather in which it took place, combined to give birth to a spirit which was to permeate the whole of the following two weeks of thrilling and intensive sport.<ref>Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948(1951), pp. 225</ref>
The opening ceremony, and over 60 hours of other coverage during the Games, was broadcast live on [[BBC]] television. The BBC had paid a sum of [[£]]1000 for the broadcasting rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/sportandsociety/exploresocsci/sportsoc/media/articles/landmarks.pdf |title=Landmarks in the history of the media and the Olympics |publisher=The british Library |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>

Wembley stadium was the venue for 33 athletics events at the Games; 24 for men and nine for women. Of these, four were making their Olympic debut – the men's 10&nbsp;km walk, and the women's 200&nbsp;metres, long jump and shot put. A total of 754 athletes from 53 countries participated in athletics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1948/ATH/ |title=Athletics at the 1948 London Summer Games |publisher=sports-reference.com |accessdate=27 April 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323175821/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1948/ATH/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] of the Netherlands, a 30-year-old mother of three children nicknamed "The Flying Housewife", won four gold medals, in the 100&nbsp;metres, 200&nbsp;metres, 80&nbsp;metre high hurdles, and 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;100&nbsp;metre relay.

The marathon saw a dramatic finish with the first man to enter the stadium, [[Etienne Gailly]] of Belgium, exhausted and nearly unable to run. While he was struggling, Argentinian athlete [[Delfo Cabrera]] and [[Tom Richards (athlete)|Tom Richards]] of Great Britain passed him, with Cabrera winning the gold medal and Richards obtaining the silver.

The decathlon was won by 17-year-old [[Bob Mathias]] of the United States. He became the youngest ever Olympic gold medallist in athletics and when asked how he would celebrate he replied: "I'll start shaving, I guess."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-02-obit-mathias_x.htm |title=Former congressman Bob Mathias dies at 75 |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |date=3 September 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/03/AR2006090300002.html |title=Bob Mathias; Congressman, Twice Olympic Champion |author=Martin Weil |work=The Washington Post |date=3 September 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>

===Basketball===
{{main|Basketball at the 1948 Summer Olympics}}
Basketball made its second appearance as a medal sport, appearing as an indoor competition for the first time after poor weather disrupted the matches at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Games]]. The event, for men only, was contested by 23 nations split into four pools for the preliminary round; the top two in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals with the other teams entering playoffs for the minor placings. The United States and France reached the final which was won by the Americans 65–21 to claim the gold medal. This was the second of the United States seven consecutive gold medals in Olympic men's and women's basketball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/BAS/mens-basketball.html |title=Basketball Men's Basketball Medalists |publisher=sports-reference.com |accessdate=27 April 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404040307/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/BAS/mens-basketball.html| archivedate= 4 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> Brazil defeated Mexico 52–47 to claim bronze.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1948/BAS/mens-basketball-final-round.html |publisher=sports-reference.com |title=Basketball at the 1948 London Summer Games: Men's Basketball Final Round |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> It must be also known that basketball itself was from beginning projected as an indoor sport, while the outdoor version was added later. This is quite unusual for Olympic games, because in fact the most sports - like athletics etc. are and were outdoor games where so called "indoor" version(like known swimming for example) were added to schedule later, by evolution(today raw version equal to initial at Olympics is called open water swimming), and there are very known differences between playing this game outdoor/indoor especially at highest level.<ref>http://www.historybits.com/basketball.htm</ref>

===Boxing===
{{main|Boxing at the 1948 Summer Olympics}}
Eight different classifications were contested ranging from [[flyweight]], for boxers weighing less than 51&nbsp;kg, to [[heavyweight]], for boxers over 80&nbsp;kg. South Africa, Argentina and Hungary each won two gold medals.

{{main|Diving at the 1948 Summer Olympics}}
Four diving events were contested, two for men, and two for women.

===Football===
{{main|Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics}}
Eighteen teams entered the football competition at these Olympics. Due to the rise of the professional game during the 12 years since the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Olympics]] the number of talented amateurs for teams to select from was reduced. The gold medal was won by Sweden, who defeated Yugoslavia 3–1 in the final. Denmark defeated hosts Great Britain, managed by [[Matt Busby]] of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], 5–3 to win the bronze medal. In the tournament's 18 matches a total of 102 goals were scored; an average 5.66 goals per match. The joint top scorers with seven goals each were [[Gunnar Nordahl]] of Sweden and Denmark's [[John Hansen (Danish footballer)|John Hansen]]. Nordahl and Swedish teammates [[Gunnar Gren]] and [[Nils Liedholm]] went on to play for [[A.C. Milan]] and together were nicknamed [[Gre-No-Li]].<ref name="FIFA">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197049/overview.html |title=London, 1948 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>

[[File:William Grut and Sune Wehlin 1948.jpg|thumb|Gold medalist William Grut of Sweden (foreground) competing in the running component of the modern pentathlon.]]
Only one [[modern pentathlon]] event was contested, the five component sports– riding, fencing, shooting, swimming, and running- being held over six days. Scoring was by point-for-place system across the five phases with the winner being the athlete with the lowest combined ranking. The sport's international federation, the [[Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne]] was founded during the Games, on 3 August 1948. Sweden won two medals in the event; [[William Grut]] won the gold, with a final points total of 16, and [[Gösta Gärdin]] took bronze. American [[George Moore (pentathlete)|George Moore]] won the silver medal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1948/MOP/ |title=Modern Pentathlon at the 1948 London Summer Games |publisher=sports-reference.com |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>

In the [[Firefly (dinghy)|Firefly]] class Danish sailor [[Paul Elvstrøm]] won gold the despite the Danish Olympic Committee having misgivings about sending him to compete as the 18-year-old could speak no English. This was the first of four consecutive Olympics with a gold medal for Elvstrøm.<ref name="ISAF"/>

===Shooting===
{{main|Shooting at the 1948 Summer Olympics}}
Four events were contested, all open to both men and women, although all medals were won by men. In the 50&nbsp;metre rifle, prone position, only two points separated the top three competitors. [[Károly Takács]] had been a member of the Hungary's world champion pistol shooting team in 1938 when a grenade shattered his right hand – his pistol hand. Takács taught himself to shoot with his left hand and, 10 years after his injury, he won an Olympic gold medal in the rapid-fire pistol event.<ref name="IOC">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/London-1948/ |title=London 1948 |publisher=olympic.org |accessdate=28 April 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503054929/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Past-Olympic-Games/Summer/London-1948/| archivedate= 3 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>

Turkey was the most successful nation with six gold medals followed by Sweden receiving 5 gold medals. These two teams claimed 24 total medals, in other words half of the total medals given.

==Political defection==
London was the first Olympics to have a political defection. [[Marie Provazníková]], the 57-year-old [[Czechoslovakia]]n President of the [[International Gymnastics Federation]], refused to return home, citing "lack of freedom" after the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|Czech coup]] in February led to the country's inclusion in the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/london-1948-to-london-2012-rags-to-riches-for-the-highclass-del-boy-who-dreamt-of-gold-not-money-783305.html |title=London 1948 to London 2012: Rags to riches for the 'high-class Del Boy' who dreamt of gold, not money |work=The Independent |date=17 February 2008 |author=Alan Hubbard |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5NDgvMDgvMTkjQXIwMDYxMw==&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-custom |title=A Political Refugee |work=The Guardian |date=19 August 1948 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

==Filming in colour==
For the Olympics, the [[Technicolor|Technicolor Corporation]] devised a [[bipack colour]] filming process – dubbed "Technichrome" – whereby hundreds of hours of film documented the events in colour, without having to use expensive and heavy Technicolor cameras.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor1.htm Widescreen Museum entry]</ref>

== Venues ==

{{Main|Venues of the 1948 Summer Olympics}}

No new venues were built for the Games. A [[cinder]] track was laid inside [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and all other venues were adapted.<ref name="British Olympic Movement">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/contentpage.aspx?page=307 |title=British Olympic Movement |publisher=British Olympic Association |accessdate=26 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094923/http://www.olympics.org.uk/contentpage.aspx?page=307 |archivedate = 8 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> For the first time at the Olympics swimming events were held undercover, at the 8000 capacity [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool]]. As the pool was longer than the standard Olympic length of 50&nbsp;metres a platform was constructed across the pool which both shortened it and housed officials.<ref name="IOC" /> In 2010 one of the last remaining venues from the Games, the [[Herne Hill Velodrome]] where cycling events were staged, was saved when a new 15-year lease was agreed meaning that repairs could take place. Campaigners and users of the track had feared that it would be forced to close as it was in desperate need of refurbishment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Last remaining 1948 Olympic Games venue is saved|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/9463862.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=26 April 2011|date=21 April 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429084019/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/9463862.stm| archivedate= 29 April 2011 <!-- DASHBot -->| deadurl=no}}</ref>
