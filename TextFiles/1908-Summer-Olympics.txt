The '''1908 Summer Olympics''', officially the '''Games of the IV Olympiad''', were an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] which was held in 1908 in [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. These games were originally scheduled to be held in [[Rome]], but were re-located on financial grounds following a disastrous eruption of [[Vesuvius#Eruptions in the 20th century|Mt Vesuvius in 1906]]. They were the fourth chronological modern [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the proposed [[Intercalated Games]] alternate four-year cycle. The [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC president]] for these Games was [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron Pierre de Coubertin]]. Lasting a total of 187 days, or 6 months and 4 days, these games were the longest in modern Olympics history.

== Background ==
The selection process for the 1908 Summer Olympics consisted of four bids, and saw [[Rome]] selected ahead of [[London]], [[Berlin]] and [[Milan]]. The selection was made at the 6th IOC Session in London in 1904.<ref name=votes>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=17 March 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xFvf0ufx |archivedate=17 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Italy|Italian]] authorities were preparing to hold the games when [[Mount Vesuvius]] erupted on 7 April 1906, devastating the city of [[Naples]]. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction of Naples, so a new venue was required. London was selected for the first time to hold the Games which were held at [[White City, London|White City]] alongside the [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]], at the time the more noteworthy event.

The [[White City Stadium]], built in short time for the games, held 68,000 and was considered by some{{Who|date=October 2008}} a technological marvel. The stadium track was three laps to the mile (536 metres), not the current standard of 400 metres, with a pool for swimming and diving and platforms for wrestling and gymnastics in the middle.<ref>Bill Mallon, Ian Buchanan. [http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/Mallon/1908.pdf The 1908 Olympic Games: Results for All Competitors in All Events], p. 5.</ref>

The distance from the start of the [[Marathon (sport)|Marathon]] to the finish at the stadium was established at these games. The original distance of 25 miles was changed to 26 miles so the marathon could start at [[Windsor Castle]] and then changed again at the request of Princess Mary so the start would be beneath the windows of the Royal Nursery.<ref name="The modern Olympics: an overview">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/04/29/f-olympics-1908.html |title =  First appearance for flags at Olympic opening ceremony |accessdate = 2008-06-30 |author = CBC Sports | work=CBC News| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603133905/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/history/story/2008/04/29/f-olympics-1908.html| archivedate= 3 June 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref> To ensure that the race would finish in front of the King, the finish line was moved by British officials who, in response to [[shot put]]ter and American flag carrier Ralph Rose's refusal to dip the American flag before the Royal Box during the opening ceremony, “felt compelled to restore the importance of the monarchy.” As a result of these changes, the marathon covered a distance of 26 miles 385 yards (42.195&nbsp;km), which became the standard length starting with the [[1924 Summer Olympics]].<ref>Rhonda Jolly (3 June 2008). {{Wayback |date=20090318000330 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/2007-08/08rp32.pdf |title=The modern Olympics: an overview }}. Department of Parliamentary Services. p. 9</ref>

== The Games ==
The games were surrounded by controversy. On the opening day, following the practice introduced at the [[1906 Summer Olympics|Intercalated Games of 1906]], teams paraded behind [[national flag]]s. However, the arrangement caused complications:
* Since [[Finland]] was part of the [[Russian Empire]], members of the Finnish team were expected to march under the [[Russia]]n rather than Finnish flag, so many chose to march without a flag at all.
* The [[Sweden|Swedish]] flag had not been displayed above the stadium, so the members of the Swedish team decided not to take part in the ceremony.

=== American refusal of flag dipping ===
The [[flag of the United States]] had also not been displayed above the stadium before the opening. The United States' flag bearer, [[Ralph Rose]], refused to [[Flag dipping|dip]] the flag to [[Edward VII|King-Emperor Edward VII]] in the royal box. However, the flag was later dipped in the collective greeting of the royal family. [[Martin Sheridan]], [[Irish American Athletic Club]] member and American team captain, is apocryphally believed to have supported Rose by explaining "This flag dips to no earthly king." It is claimed that his statement exemplified both American and Irish defiance of the British monarchy. However, research has shown that this quotation by Sheridan was first reported in 1952, some 24 years after his death.<ref name="la84foundation.org">{{cite journal|author=Bill Mallon and Ian Buchanan |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv7n3/JOHv7n3i.pdf |title=To No Earthly King ... |journal=Journal of Olympic History |year=1999 |page=21}}</ref><ref>{{Wayback |date=20061010154104 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/06/24/olympics_history_feature.shtml |title=London Olympics 1908 & 1948 }}.

=== Events ===
The 1908 Olympics also prompted establishment of standard rules for sports, and selection of judges from different countries rather than just the host. One reason was the 400 meter run in which the US winner was accused of interfering with the British runner. Part of the problem was the different definition of interference under British and US rules. The race was re-run, but the Americans refused to participate. The British runner, [[Wyndham Halswelle]], won by running around the track on his own, because three of the four original runners had been American, the only [[Walkover (contest)|walkover]] in Olympic history.

The combatants are as elaborately protected as a German student duellist, and even the revolver has a large hand-guard. The helmet has a plate-glass window."]]

The most famous incident of the games came at the end of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]]. The first to enter the stadium, [[Dorando Pietri]] of Italy, collapsed several times and ran the wrong way. Not far from the finish-line, two of the officials, Jack Andrew, the clerk of the course and Dr Michael Bulger of the Irish Amateur Athletic Association and the chief medical officer that day, went to his aid.  Pietri eventually crossed the line in first place, but the runner-up, American [[Johnny Hayes]] of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]] protested, leading to Pietri's disqualification. Since he had not been responsible for his disqualification, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] awarded him a gilded silver cup the next day.

These Games were the first to include winter events, as had originally been proposed for the Games. There were four [[Figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|figure skating]] events, although held on October 28 and 29, months after the other events.

[[Oscar Swahn]] from [[Sweden]], who won the gold medal for running deer shooting, became the oldest Olympic champion of all time, and set another age record by being 72 years and 279 days old during his triumph at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. One of the more unusual shooting event in 1908 was dueling. The discipline, which was an associate event (i.e. not official), was performed by facing opponents wearing protective clothing and masks and firing wax bullets.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sketch: A Journal of Art and Actuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roI4AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA40|edition=No. 808 Vol LXIII, Sixpence|date=1908-07-22|publisher=Ingram brothers|page=41}}</ref>

Tragically, Taylor "died on December 2, 1908, after his return to the United States, much regretted by all who met him [there]."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

The budget of the organising committee showed a cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]15,000; over one-third was labeled "entertainment expense". Donations were the major source of revenue; only 28% of income derived from ticket sales. Total receipts of £21,377 resulted in organisers claiming a profit. Construction of the [[White City Stadium]], which cost the government about £60,000, was not counted.<ref name=Zarnowski>{{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C.

== Sports ==
22 sports, representing 110 events in 24 sporting disciplines, were contested. Swimming, diving and water polo are considered three disciplines of the same sport, ''aquatics''. At the time, tug-of-war was part of athletics and the two different [[football]] codes ([[Football (soccer)|association]] and [[Rugby football|rugby (union)]]) were listed together. The International Olympic Committee now considers tug-of-war a separate sport, as well as referring to association football as simply "football" and to rugby union as "rugby".<ref name=OldSports>[http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/past/index_uk.asp Olympic Sports of the Past]. Olympic.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-09.</ref> In one of seven Cycling events (Cycling sprint) no medals were awarded. The Sailing program was open for a total of five sailing classes, but actually only four Sailing events were contested. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

The 1908 Games featured athletes representing 22 [[National Olympic Committee]]s. [[Finland]], [[Turkey]] and [[New Zealand]] (as part of the team from [[Australasia]]) made their first appearance at the Olympic Games. The fact that the United Kingdom competed as a single team was upsetting to some Irish competitors, who felt that Ireland should compete on its own, despite being part of the UK at the time. Fearing an Irish boycott, the authorities changed the name of the team to Great Britain/Ireland, and in two sports, field hockey and polo, Ireland participated as a separate country, winning silver medals in both.<ref>Irish Times, 4 August 2008, article by Kevin Mallon</ref> Irish athletes in the United States were not affected by this controversy, and many Irish born athletes competed for the [[U.S. Olympic team]] as members of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]]. Members of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]] won ten of the U.S. Olympic team's total 23 gold medals, or as many as the nations of [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] combined.
