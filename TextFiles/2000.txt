'''2000''' ('''[[Roman numerals|MM]]''') was a [[century leap year|century]] [[leap year]] [[leap year starting on Saturday|starting on Saturday]], in accordance with the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It was the 2000th year of the [[Common Era]] or the [[Anno Domini]] designation, the 1000th and last year of the [[2nd millennium]], the 100th and last year of the [[20th century]], and the 1st year of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].-->

2000 was designated as:
* [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/|title=CULTURE OF PEACE WEBSITE|publisher=}}</ref>
* World [[Mathematics|Mathematical]] Year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.ac.uk/wmy2kposters/|title=Isaac Newton Maths posters in the London Underground|publisher=}}</ref>

Popular culture holds the year 2000 as the first year of the [[21st century]] and the [[3rd millennium]] due to a tendency of grouping the years according to [[decimal]] values, as if [[0 (year)|year zero]] were counted. According to the Gregorian Calendar, these distinctions fall to the year [[2001]] because the 1st century was retroactively said to start with year [[1|AD 1]]. Since the calendar does not have year zero, its first millennium spanned from years 1 to 1000 inclusively and its second millennium from years 1001 to 2000 (See more at ''[[Millennium]]'').

The year 2000 is sometimes abbreviated as "Y2K" (the "Y" stands for "year", and the "K" stands for "[[kilo-|kilo]]" which means "thousand").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarhome.com/clink/y2000.html |title=Y2K, After the Hype |publisher=CalendarHome.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=TINA KELLEYPublished: December 27, 1999 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/27/nyregion/y2k-stands-for-the-year-2000-now-that-wasn-t-really-difficult-was-it.html |title='Y2K' Stands for the Year 2000. Now That Wasn't Really Difficult, Was It? - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1999-12-27 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref> The year 2000 was the subject of [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K concerns]], which are  fears that computers would not shift from 1999 to 2000 correctly. However, by the end of 1999, many companies had already converted to new, or upgraded, existing software. Some even obtained ''[[Y2K]] certification''. As a result of massive effort, relatively few problems occurred.
