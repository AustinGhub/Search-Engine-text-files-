The '''2003 invasion of Iraq''' lasted from 20 March to 1 May 2003 and signaled the start of the [[Iraq War]], which was dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States (prior to 19 March, the mission in Iraq was called [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], a carryover from the [[NATO War in Afghanistan|War in Afghanistan]]).<ref>https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS21405.pdf</ref> The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Spain]] and [[Poland]] invaded [[Iraq]] and deposed the [[Ba'athist]] [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|government]] of [[Saddam Hussein]]. The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] by American forces with the implicit assistance of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Spain]] and [[Poland]].

160,000 troops were sent by the Coalition into Iraq, during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 9 April 2003. About 130,000 were sent from the USA alone, with about 28,000 British Soldiers, Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|36 other countries]] were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in [[Kuwait]] by 18 February.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/18/sprj.irq.deployment/index.html|title=U.S. has 100,000 troops in Kuwait |publisher=CNN |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> The coalition forces also received support from [[Peshmerga|Kurdish irregulars]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

According to U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]], the coalition mission was "to disarm Iraq of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people."<ref name="beginning1" /> General [[Wesley Clark]], the former Supreme NATO Allied Commander and Joint Chiefs of Staff Director of Strategy and Policy, describes in his 2003 book, ''Winning Modern Wars'', his conversation with a military officer in the Pentagon shortly after the 11 September attacks regarding a plan to attack seven Middle Eastern countries in five years: "As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia and Sudan."<ref>Wesley Clark, ''Winning Modern Wars'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2003), 130</ref> Others play a much greater emphasis on the impact of the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations, and the rise of the freedom agenda.<ref name="GSN-MEI, Saddam connection">{{cite journal|title=US Hardliners search for a Saddam connection|journal=Gulf States Newsletter's Middle East Insider|date=September 2001|issue=9|url=http://www.gsn-online.com/us-hardliners-search-for-a-saddam-connection-911}}</ref><ref>Oz Hassan (2012) ''Constructing America's Freedom Agenda for the Middle East'' http://www.amazon.co.uk/Constructing-Americas-Freedom-Agenda-Middle/dp/0415603102/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1348997756&sr=8-1</ref> According to Blair, the trigger was Iraq's failure to take a "final opportunity" to disarm itself of alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030131-23.html |title=President Bush Meets with Prime Minister Blair |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=31 January 2003 |accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref>

In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war.<ref name="CBSnews-20030124">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml "Poll: Talk First, Fight Later"].

The invasion was preceded by an [[air strike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi army]] to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the [[military occupation]] period.

Hostilities of the 1991 Gulf War were suspended on 28 February 1991, with a cease-fire negotiated between the UN Coalition and Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/timeline/content/1991/april.html|title=Gulf War Timeline|year=2001|publisher=CNN|accessdate=22 December 2008 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20050428175318/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/timeline/content/1991/april.html |archivedate =28 April 2005}}</ref> The U.S. and its allies tried to keep Saddam in check with military actions such as [[Operation Southern Watch]], which was conducted by Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA) with the mission of monitoring and controlling airspace south of the [[32nd parallel north|32nd Parallel]] (extended to the [[33rd parallel north|33rd Parallel]] in 1996) as well as using economic sanctions. It was revealed that a [[biological weapons]] (BW) program in Iraq had begun in the early 1980s with help from the U.S. and Europe in violation of the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC) of 1972. Details of the BW program—along with a chemical weapons program—surfaced in the wake of the Gulf War (1990–91) following investigations conducted by the [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM) which had been charged with the post-war disarmament of Saddam's Iraq. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence the program had continued after the war. The U.S. and its allies then maintained a policy of "[[containment]]" towards Iraq. This policy involved numerous [[Iraq sanctions|economic sanctions]] by the [[UN Security Council]]; the enforcement of [[Iraqi no-fly zones]] declared by the U.S. and the UK to protect the [[Kurds]] in Iraqi Kurdistan and [[Shia]]s in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government; and ongoing inspections. Iraqi military helicopters and planes regularly contested the no-fly zones.<ref name ="CNN-20060525">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9901/04/iraq.no.fly/|title=Iraq tests no-fly zone|date=4 January 1999|publisher=CNN|accessdate=25 May 2006}}</ref><ref name ="CNN-20021128">{{cite news|url=http://cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/11/28/sproject.irq.nofly.zone/index.html|title=Coalition planes hit Iraq sites in no-fly zone|date=28 November 2002|publisher=CNN|accessdate=25 May 2006}}</ref>

In October 1998, removing the Hussein regime became official [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] with enactment of the [[Iraq Liberation Act]]. Enacted following the expulsion of [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|UN weapons inspectors]] the preceding August (after some had been accused of spying for the U.S.), the act provided $97 million for Iraqi "democratic opposition organizations" to "establish a program to support a transition to democracy in Iraq."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR:|title=Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed by Both House and Senate)|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=25 May 2006}}{{Dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> This legislation contrasted with the terms set out in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687]], which focused on weapons and weapons programs and made no mention of regime change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/news/un/iraq/sres/sres0687.htm|title=RESOLUTION 687 (1991)|accessdate=25 May 2006|date=8 April 1991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523015627/https://fas.org/news/un/iraq/sres/sres0687.htm|archivedate=23 May 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> One month after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act, the U.S. and UK launched a bombardment campaign of Iraq called [[Operation Desert Fox]].

With the election of George W. Bush as [[President of the United States|president]] in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], the U.S. moved towards a more aggressive policy toward Iraq. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party's]] campaign platform in the 2000 election called for "full implementation" of the Iraq Liberation Act as "a starting point" in a plan to "remove" Hussein.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/conventions/republican/features/platform.00/|title=REPUBLICAN PLATFORM 2000|publisher=CNN|accessdate=25 May 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421063832/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/conventions/republican/features/platform.00/|archivedate=21 April 2006}}</ref> After leaving the [[George W. Bush administration]], Treasury Secretary [[Paul O'Neill (businessman)|Paul O'Neill]] said that an attack on Iraq had been planned since Bush's inauguration, and that the first [[United States National Security Council]] meeting involved discussion of an invasion. O'Neill later backtracked, saying that these discussions were part of a continuation of foreign policy first put into place by the [[Clinton administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/13/oneill.bush/|title=O'Neill: 'Frenzy' distorted war plans account|date=14 January 2004|publisher=CNN|accessdate=26 May 2006}}</ref>

Despite the Bush administration's stated interest in liberating Iraq, little formal movement towards an invasion occurred until the [[11 September 2001 attacks]]. For example, the administration prepared [[Operation Desert Badger]] to respond aggressively if any [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilot was shot down while flying over Iraq, but this did not happen. Rumsfeld dismissed [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) intercept data available by midday of the 11th that pointed to [[al-Qaeda]]'s culpability, and by mid-afternoon ordered the Pentagon to prepare plans for attacking Iraq.<ref>Richard Aldrich, 'An extra copy for Mr Philby,' in ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 19 February 2010 pp.7–8, p.7</ref> According to aides who were with him in the [[National Military Command Center]] on that day, Rumsfeld asked for: "best info fast.

Shortly after 11 September 2001 (on 20 September), Bush addressed a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] (simulcast live to the world), and announced his new "[[War on Terror]]". This announcement was accompanied by the doctrine of "pre-emptive" military action, later termed the [[Bush Doctrine]]. Allegations of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were made by some [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] officials who asserted that a highly secretive relationship existed between Saddam and the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant organization [[al-Qaeda]] from 1992 to 2003, specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] (IIS). Some Bush advisers favored an immediate invasion of Iraq, while others advocated building an international coalition and obtaining United Nations authorization. Bush eventually decided to seek UN authorization, while still reserving the option of invading without it.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/cron.html "Chronology of the Bush Doctrine"].

Key U.S. allies in [[NATO]], such as the United Kingdom, agreed with the U.S. actions, while France and Germany were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]], which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised "serious consequences" for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2364203.stm "France threatens rival UN Iraq draft"].

Resolution 1441 gave Iraq "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations" and set up inspections by the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). Hussein accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman [[Hans Blix]] and IAEA Director General [[Mohamed ElBaradei]]. As of February 2003, the IAEA "found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statements of the Director General|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebsp2003n006.shtml|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=7 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903185204/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebsp2003n006.shtml|archivedate=3 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> UNMOVIC "did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programs of weapons of mass destruction" or significant quantities of proscribed items.

In October 2002, the U.S. Congress passed a "[[Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq]]". The resolution authorized the President to "use any means necessary" against Iraq. Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush's plan. The U.S. government engaged in an elaborate [[Public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|domestic public relations campaign]] to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. Of those who thought Iraq had weapons sequestered somewhere, about half responded that said weapons would not be found in combat. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Hussein from power.<ref name = "CBSnews-20030124"/>

The [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) teams, consisting of the paramilitary operations officers and [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces Group]] soldiers, were the first U.S. forces to enter Iraq, in July 2002, before the main invasion. Once on the ground, they prepared for the subsequent arrival of [[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Army Special Forces]] to organize the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]]. This joint team (called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element (NILE))<ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004">''Plan of Attack'', Bob Woodward, Simon and Schuster, 2004.</ref> combined to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], a group with ties to al-Qaeda, in Iraqi Kurdistan. This battle was for control of the territory that was occupied by Ansar al-Islam and took place before the invasion. It was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD and the Army's 10th Special Forces Group.

SAD teams also conducted missions behind enemy lines to identify leadership targets. These missions led to the initial [[air strike]]s against Hussein and his generals. Although the strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing him, it effectively ended his ability to [[command and control]] his forces.

As a follow-up to Powell’s presentation, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but NATO members like Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy.

During the debate, it was stated that the [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Attorney General]] had advised that the war was legal under previous UN Resolutions.

In December 2002, a representative of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General [[Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti]], contacted former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] Counterterrorism Department head [[Vincent Cannistraro]] stating that Hussein "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)." Cannistraro further added that "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it." Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all "killed" by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Hussein to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.<ref name="WaPo">{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/26/us-iraq-bush-spain-idUSL2683831120070926 |title=Bush thought Saddam was prepared to flee: report |author=Jason Webb |agency=Reuters |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=27 September 2007}}</ref>

Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s national security advisor, [[Osama El-Baz]], sent a message to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that the country had weapons of mass destruction and ties with Al-Qaeda. Iraq also attempted to reach the U.S. through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services.

In January 2003, [[Lebanese-American]] [[Imad Hage]] met with [[Michael Maloof]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]'s [[Office of Special Plans]]. Hage, a resident of [[Beirut]], had been recruited by the department to assist in the [[War on Terror]].

In January 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligence's foreign operations, [[Hassan al-Obeidi]]. Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad did not understand why they were being targeted, and that they had no WMDs. He then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to confirm this. He additionally offered petroleum concessions, but stopped short of having Hussein give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted.<ref name="transcripts.cnn.com" />

Later that month, Hage met with General Habbush and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]]. He was offered top priority to U.S. firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, U.S. inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent [[Abdul Rahman Yasin]] (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give "full support for any U.S. plan" in the [[Arab-Israeli peace process]]. They also wished to meet with high-ranking U.S. officials. On 19 February, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to [[Jamie Duran]]. [[The Pentagon]] denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran's bosses, were aware of the plan.<ref name="transcripts.cnn.com" />

On 21 February, Maloof informed Duran in an email that [[Richard Perle]] wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it. Duran responded "Mike, working this. Keep this close hold." On 7 March, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting). A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perle's response was "that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go").

At a press conference on 31 January 2003, Bush again reiterated that the single trigger for the invasion would be Iraq’s failure to disarm, "Saddam Hussein must understand that if he does not disarm, for the sake of peace, we, along with others, will go disarm Saddam Hussein."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/01/31/sprj.irq.bush.blair.topics/|title=Bush, Blair: Time running out for Saddam|publisher=CNN |date=31 January 2003|accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> As late as 25 February 2003, it was still the official line that the only cause of invasion would be a failure to disarm.

While it never made an explicit connection between Iraq and the 11 September attacks, the George W. Bush administration repeatedly insinuated a link, thereby creating a false impression for the U.S. public. Grand jury testimony from the [[1993 World Trade Center attack]] trials cited numerous direct linkages from the bombers to Baghdad and Department 13 of the Iraqi Intelligence Service in that initial attack marking the second anniversary to vindicate the surrender of Iraqi armed forces in [[Operation Desert Storm]]. For example, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has noted that,

{{quote|While not explicitly declaring Iraqi culpability in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, administration officials did, at various times, imply a link. In late 2001, Cheney said it was "pretty well confirmed" that attack mastermind Mohamed Atta had met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official. Later, Cheney called Iraq the "geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9/11."<ref>{{cite news |first=Dana |last=Milbank |title=Bush Defends Assertions of Iraq-Al Qaeda Relationship |work=The Washington Post |date=18 June 2004 |page=A09 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50679-2004Jun17.html |accessdate =22 October 2007}}</ref>}}

Steven Kull, director of the [[Program on International Policy Attitudes]] (PIPA) at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], observed in March 2003 that "The administration has succeeded in creating a sense that there is some connection [between 11 Sept. and Saddam Hussein]". This was following a ''[[New York Times]]''/[[CBS]] poll that showed 45% of Americans believing Saddam Hussein was "personally involved" in the 11 September atrocities. As the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' observed at the time, while "Sources knowledgeable about U.S. intelligence say there is no evidence that Hussein played a role in the 11 Sept. attacks, nor that he has been or is currently aiding Al Qaeda. ... the White House appears to be encouraging this false impression, as it seeks to maintain American support for a possible war against Iraq and demonstrate seriousness of purpose to Hussein's regime." The CSM went on to report that, while polling data collected "right after 11 Sept. 2001" showed that only 3 percent mentioned Iraq or Saddam Hussein, by January 2003 attitudes "had been transformed" with a Knight Ridder poll showing that 44% of Americans believed "most" or "some" of the 11 September hijackers were Iraqi citizens.<ref>{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Feldmann |title=The impact of Bush linking 9/11 and Iraq |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=14 March 2003 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html |accessdate=22 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032450/http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html|archivedate=30 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

According to [[General Tommy Franks]], the objectives of the invasion were, "First, end the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to search for, to capture and to drive out terrorists from that country. Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. Seventh, to secure Iraq’s oil fields and resources, which belong to the Iraqi people. And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sale |first=Michelle |url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/missions-accomplished |title=Missions Accomplished? |work=New York Times |date=11 April 2003 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref>

The [[BBC]] has also noted that, while President Bush "never directly accused the former Iraqi leader of having a hand in the attacks on New York and Washington", he "repeatedly associated the two in keynote addresses delivered since 11 September", adding that "Senior members of his administration have similarly conflated the two." For instance, the BBC report quotes Colin Powell in February 2003, stating that "We've learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September 11, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America." The same BBC report also noted the results of a recent opinion poll, which suggested that "70% of Americans believe the Iraqi leader was personally involved in the attacks."<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Bush administration on Iraq 9/11 link |date=18 September 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3119676.stm |accessdate =22 October 2007}}</ref>

Also in September 2003, the ''Boston Globe'' reported that "Vice President Dick Cheney, anxious to defend the White House foreign policy amid ongoing violence in Iraq, stunned intelligence analysts and even members of his own administration this week by failing to dismiss a widely discredited claim: that Saddam Hussein might have played a role in the 11 Sept. attacks."<ref>{{cite news |first1=Anne E. |last1=Kornblut |first2=Bryan |last2=Bender |title=Cheney link of Iraq, 9/11 challenged |date=16 September 2003 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/09/16/cheney_link_of_iraq_911_challenged/ |accessdate=22 October 2007 |work=The Boston Globe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005142107/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/09/16/cheney_link_of_iraq_911_challenged/|archivedate= 5 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> A year later, presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] alleged that Cheney was continuing "to intentionally mislead the American public by drawing a link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 in an attempt to make the invasion of Iraq part of the global war on terror."<ref>{{cite news |title=Kerry challenges Bush on Iraq-9/11 connection |publisher=CNN |date=13 September 2004 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/12/kerry.powell.iraq/index.html |accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref>

Throughout 2002, the Bush administration insisted that removing Hussein from power to restore international peace and security was a major goal. The principal stated justifications for this policy of "regime change" were that Iraq's [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|continuing production of weapons of mass destruction]] and [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda|known ties to terrorist organizations]], as well as Iraq's continued violations of UN Security Council resolutions, amounted to a threat to the U.S. and the world community.

{{Wikisource|Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 address to The United Nations Security Council}}
The Bush administration's overall rationale for the invasion of Iraq was presented in detail by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 5 February 2003. In summary, he stated,
{{quote|We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction; he's determined to make more. Given Saddam Hussein's history of aggression ... given what we know of his terrorist associations and given his determination to exact revenge on those who oppose him, should we take the risk that he will not some day use these weapons at a time and the place and in the manner of his choosing at a time when the world is in a much weaker position to respond? The United States will not and cannot run that risk to the American people. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post–September 11 world.<ref name="CNNtranscript">[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.transcript/index.html "Transcript of Powell's U.N.

Since the invasion, the U.S. and British government statements concerning Iraqi weapons programs and links to terrorist organizations have been discredited. While the debate of whether Iraq intended to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons in the future remains open, no WMDs have been found in Iraq since the invasion despite comprehensive inspections lasting more than 18 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7634313/ |title=CIA's final report: No WMD found in Iraq |publisher=MSNBC |date=25 April 2005 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref> In Cairo, on 24 February 2001, Colin Powell had predicted as much, saying, "[Hussein] has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction.

In September 2002, the Bush administration said attempts by Iraq to acquire thousands of high-strength [[Iraqi aluminum tubes|aluminum tubes]] pointed to a clandestine program to make enriched uranium for nuclear bombs. Powell, in his address to the UN Security Council just before the war, referred to the aluminum tubes. A report released by the [[Institute for Science and International Security]] in 2002, however, reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium. Powell later admitted he had presented an inaccurate case to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons, based on sourcing that was wrong and in some cases "deliberately misleading."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A36348-2002Sep18 "Evidence on Iraq Challenged,"]{{Dead link|date=August 2012}} Joby Warrick, ''The Washington Post'', 19 September 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/transcripts/powelltext_020503.html Colin Powell’s speech to the UN], 5 February 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4992558/ Meet the Press], NBC, 16 May 2004</ref>

These documents were dismissed by the IAEA as forgeries, with the concurrence in that judgment of outside experts. At the time, a US official stated that the evidence was submitted to the IAEA without knowledge of its provenance and characterized any mistakes as "more likely due to incompetence not malice".

===Iraqi drones===
In October 2002, a few days before the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] vote on the [[Legality of the Iraq War#United States|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution]], about 75 senators were told in [[closed session]] that the Iraqi government had the means of delivering [[biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]] of mass destruction by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) drones that could be launched from ships off the US' Atlantic coast to attack [[East Coast of the United States|US eastern seaboard cities]]. [[Colin Powell]] suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the United States.

In fact, Iraq had no offensive UAV fleet or any capability of putting UAVs on ships.<ref>Senator [[Bill Nelson]] (28 January 2004) [https://fas.org/irp/congress/2004_cr/s012804b.html "New Information on Iraq's Possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction",] ''Congressional Record''</ref> Iraq's UAV fleet consisted of less than a handful of outdated Czech training drones.<ref>Lowe, C.

The [[US Air Force]] agency denied outright that Iraq possessed any offensive UAV capability.<ref>Hammond, J.

===Human rights===
As evidence supporting U.S. and British charges about Iraqi WMDs and links to terrorism weakened, some supporters of the invasion have increasingly shifted their justification to the [[Human rights in Saddam's Iraq|human rights violations of the Hussein government]].<ref>[http://www.turks.us/article.php?story=20030730114304428 Senators Slam Shifting Iraq War Justification.] Islamonline. 30 July 2003.</ref> Leading human rights groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]] have argued, however, that they believe human rights concerns were never a central justification for the invasion, nor do they believe that military intervention was justifiable on humanitarian grounds, most significantly because "the killing in Iraq at the time was not of the exceptional nature that would justify such intervention."<ref>Roth, Ken.

Citing the [[Iraq Liberation Act of 1998]], the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.

The resolution "supported" and "encouraged" diplomatic efforts by President George W. Bush to "strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq" and "obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq." The resolution authorized President Bush to use the [[Armed Forces of the United States]] "as he determines to be necessary and appropriate" to "defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant [[United Nations Security Council]] Resolutions regarding Iraq."

The legality of the invasion of Iraq has been challenged since its inception on a number of fronts, and several prominent supporters of the invasion in all the invading nations have publicly and privately cast doubt on its legality. It has been argued that the invasion was fully legal because authorization was implied by the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/iraq/decade/sect2.html |title=Saddam Hussein's Defiance of UNSCRs |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref><ref>[http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/3389229.47645187.html UN Security Council Resolution 1441] {{Dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> International legal experts, including the [[International Commission of Jurists]], a group of 31 leading Canadian law professors, and the U.S.-based Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, have denounced both of these rationales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robincmiller.com/ir-legal.htm |title=Links to Opinions of Legality of War Against Iraq |publisher=Robincmiller.com |accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0321-10.htm |title=Law Groups Say U.S. Invasion Illegal |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=21 March 2003 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040215193958/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0321-10.htm |archivedate=15 February 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj.org/news.php3?id_article=2770&lang=en |title=International Commission of Jurists |publisher=Icj.org |date=18 March 2003 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407232423/http://www.icj.org/news.php3?id_article=2770&lang=en |archivedate=7 April 2003 }}</ref>

The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|678]], passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes "member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means" to (1) implement Security Council Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 660|660]] and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) "restore international peace and security in the area." Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|678]] has not been rescinded or nullified by succeeding resolutions and Iraq was not alleged after 1991 to invade Kuwait or to threaten do so.

Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|1441]] was most prominent during the run up to the war and formed the main backdrop for Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]]'s address to the Security Council one month before the invasion.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.transcript/index.html Transcript of Powell's U.N. Presentation]. CNN.com.</ref> According to an independent commission of inquiry set up by the government of the Netherlands, UN resolution 1441 "cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council's resolutions." Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the 2003 invasion violated international law.<ref>The Guardian, 12 January 2010, "Iraq Invasion Violated International Law, Dutch Inquiry Finds: Investigation into the Netherlands' Support for 2003 War Finds Military Action was Not Justified under UN Resolutions," http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/12/iraq-invasion-violated-interational-law-dutch-inquiry-finds</ref>

''"The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder."'' The Senate committee found that many of the administration's pre-war statements about Iraqi WMD were not supported by the underlying intelligence]]

At the same time, Bush Administration officials advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force in response to Iraq's 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]]. Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of [[U.N. Security Council]] Resolutions 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraq's compliance through military means.

Critics and proponents of the legal rationale based on the U.N. resolutions argue that the legal right to determine how to enforce its resolutions lies with the Security Council alone, not with individual nations.

In February 2006, [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], the lead prosecutor for the [[International Criminal Court]], reported that he had received 240 separate communications regarding the legality of the war, many of which concerned British participation in the invasion.<ref>Richard Norton-Taylor, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,5187283-111289,00.html "International court hears anti-war claims"],{{dead link|date=April 2015}} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 May 2005.</ref> In a letter addressed to the complainants, Mr. Moreno Ocampo explained that he could only consider issues related to conduct during the war and not to its underlying legality as a possible crime of aggression because no provision had yet been adopted which "defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it." In a March 2007 interview with the [[Sunday Telegraph]], Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes.<ref>Chamberlin, Gethin.

United States Ohio Congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]] held a press conference on the evening of 24 April 2007, revealing [[US House Resolution 333]] and the three articles of impeachment against Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. He charged Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq's weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq's connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the [[United Nations Charter]].

The United Kingdom military operation was named ''[[Operation Telic]]''.

===Multilateral support===

CIA [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) Paramilitary teams entered Iraq in July 2002 before the 2003 invasion. Once on the ground they prepared for the subsequent arrival of US military forces. SAD teams then combined with [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] to organize the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]]. This joint team combined to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], an ally of Al Qaida, in a battle in the northeast corner of Iraq. The U.S. side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army's [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces Group]].<ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /><ref name="Tucker 2008" /><ref name="charles-faddis-interview" />

SAD teams also conducted high-risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial strikes against Hussein were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force coming from the south.<ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /><ref name="charles-faddis-interview" />

SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.<ref name="Tucker 2008" /> NATO member [[Turkey]] refused to allow its territory to be used for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG and U.S. Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga constituted the entire northern force against government forces during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of the Iraqi army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than moving to contest the coalition force.

According to [[Tommy Franks|General Tommy Franks]], [[April Fool (spy)|April Fool]], an American officer working [[undercover]] as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi [[intelligence agent]]. April Fool then sold to the Iraqi false "top secret" invasion plans provided by Franks' team. This [[decoy]] deception successfully misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in Northern and Western Iraq in anticipation of attacks by way of [[Turkey]] or [[Jordan]], which never took place. This greatly reduced the defensive capacity in the rest of Iraq and significantly facilitated the actual attacks via [[Kuwait]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] in the southeast.

During the invasion, foreign volunteers traveled to Iraq from [[Syria]] and took part in the fighting, usually under the command of the Fedayeen Saddam. It is not known for certain how many foreign fighters fought in Iraq in 2003, however, intelligence officers of the U.S. First Marine Division estimated that 50% of all Iraqi combatants in central Iraq were foreigners.<ref name="Generation1">[[Evan Wright]], ''Generation Kill'', page 249.

In addition, the Kurdish Islamist militant group [[Ansar al-Islam]] controlled a small section of northern Iraq in an area outside of Saddam Hussein's control. Ansar al-Islam had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At the time of the invasion they fielded approximately 600 to 800 fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1016/p12s01-woiq.html |title=The rise and fall of Ansar al-Islam |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=16 October 2003 |first=Scott |last=Peterson|accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Ansar al-Islam was led by the Jordanian-born militant [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], who would later become an important leader in the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]].

A change in enforcement tactics was acknowledged at the time, but it was not made public that this was part of a plan known as [[Operation Southern Focus]].

The amount of [[Aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] dropped on Iraqi positions by Coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 was less than in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration.<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020206/text/20206w16.htm |title=UK Parliamentary transcript |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref> This information has been used to attempt to refute the theory that the Bush administration had already decided to go to war against Iraq before coming to office and that the bombing during 2001 and 2002 was laying the groundwork for the eventual invasion in 2003. However, information obtained by the UK [[Liberal Democrats]] showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq in the second half of 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14&nbsp;tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6&nbsp;tons in September – before Congress' 11 October [[Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq|authorization of the invasion]].

The 5 September attacks included a 100+ aircraft attack on the main air defense site in western Iraq. According to an editorial in ''[[New Statesman]]'' this was "Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias, it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected."<ref name="newstatebomb">{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300013 |title=The war before the war |first=Michael |last=Smith |work=New Statesman |location=UK|date=30 May 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813134402/http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300013|archivedate=13 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Tommy Franks, who commanded the invasion of Iraq, has since admitted that the bombing was designed to "degrade" Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf War. These "spikes of activity" were, in the words of then British Defence Secretary, [[Geoff Hoon]], designed to 'put pressure on the Iraqi regime' or, as ''[[The Times]]'' reported, to "provoke Saddam Hussein into giving the allies an excuse for war". In this respect, as provocations designed to start a war, leaked British Foreign Office legal advice concluded that such attacks were illegal under international law.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527701.ece |title=RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=1 September 2008 |first=Michael |last=Smith |date=29 May 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727015416/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527701.ece|archivedate=27 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article535045.ece |title=British bombing raids were illegal, says Foreign Office – Times Online |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=1 September 2008 |first=Michael |last=Smith |date=19 June 2005}}</ref>

Another attempt at provoking the war was mentioned in a leaked memo from a meeting between George W. Bush and Tony Blair on 31 January 2003 at which Bush allegedly told Blair that "The US was thinking of flying [[Lockheed U-2|U2]] reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in UN colours.

Before the invasion, many observers had expected a lengthy campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see [[Shock and Awe]]), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.

Following [[Turkey]]'s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.<ref>''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press.</ref> Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in [[Kuwait]] and other [[Persian Gulf]] nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.

The invasion was swift, leading to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set many oil wells on fire]] in an attempt to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around [[Basra]] and the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] with explosives. Coalition troops launched an air and [[amphibious assault]] on the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Polish Navy]], and [[Royal Australian Navy]].

In the meantime, Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked the radar defence systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on 22 March along with the pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams), shot down by an American Patriot missile as they returned to their airbase in Kuwait.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|title=Coroner condemns 'glaring failures' that led to US missile killing RAF crew|work=the Guardian}}</ref> On 1 April, an F-14 from USS Kitty Hawk crashed in southern Iraq reportedly due to engine failure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|title=f-14|publisher=}}</ref> and a S-3B Viking plunged off the deck of the USS Constellation after a malfunction and an AV-8B Harrier jump jet went into the Gulf while it was trying to land on the USS Nassau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|title=The following was received from a PJ in Operation Iraqi Freedom|publisher=}}</ref>

British [[3 Commando Brigade]], with the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] and the [[Poland|Polish]] Special Forces unit [[GROM]] attached, attacked the port of [[Umm Qasr]]. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30–40 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The [[British Army]]'s [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like [[Rumaila Field|Rumaila]] while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War.

In keeping with the rapid advance plan, the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]] moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]] moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] moved northward through the eastern marshland.

During the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a [[Scud]] missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in [[Camp Doha]], Kuwait. The missile was intercepted and shot down by a [[Patriot missile]] seconds before hitting the complex. Subsequently, two [[A-10 Warthog]]s bombed the missile launcher.

====Battle of Nasiriyah====
{{Main|Battle of Nasiriyah}}
Initially, the U.S. [[1st Marine Division]] fought through the [[Rumaila oil field]]s, and moved north to [[Nasiriyah]]—a moderate-sized, Shi'ite-dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and its proximity to nearby [[Ali Air Base|Talil Airfield]]. It was also situated near a number of strategically important bridges over the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]]. The city was defended by a mix of regular Iraqi army units, Ba'ath loyalists, and Fedayeen from both Iraq and abroad. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west.

On 23 March, a convoy from the 3rd Infantry Division, including the female American soldiers [[Jessica Lynch]], [[Shoshana Johnson]], and [[Lori Piestewa]], was ambushed after taking a wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.Army.mil/features/507thMaintCmpy |title=Attack on the 507th Maintenance Company |publisher=[[The United States Army]] |date=17 July 2003|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iSuYuP2L|archivedate=22 July 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> Piestewa died of wounds shortly after capture, while the remaining five prisoners of war were later rescued.

An [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|Air Force A-10]] was involved in a case of [[friendly fire]] that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle.

On the evening of 24 March, [[2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion]], which was attached to [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|Regimental Combat Team One (RCT-1)]], pushed through Nasiriyah and established a perimeter 15&nbsp;kilometers (9.3&nbsp;miles) north of the city. Iraqi reinforcements from [[Kut]] launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200–300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyah's strategic position as a road junction, a significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city's surrounding highways.

With the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some {{convert|10|mi|km}} outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The [[101st Airborne Division]] continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.

By 28 March, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive half way between Najaf and Karbala. As a result of heavy rains that occurred along with the sand storm, orange-colored mud fell on some parts of the invasion force in the area. Air operations by helicopters, poised to bring reinforcements from the 101st Airborne, were blocked for three days. There was particularly heavy fighting in and around the bridge near the town of Kufl.

====Battle of Najaf====
{{Main|Battle of Najaf (2003)}}
[[File:DestroyedT-72outsidenajaf.jpg|thumb|Destroyed Iraqi [[T-72]] tank on Highway 9 outside [[Najaf]]]]

Another fierce battle was at [[Najaf]], where U.S. airborne and armored units with British air support fought an intense battle with Iraqi Regulars, Republican Guard units, and paramilitary forces. It started with U.S. [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopter gunships setting out on a mission to attack Republican Guard armored units; while flying low the Apaches came under heavy anti-aircraft, small arms, and RPG fire which heavily damaged many helicopters and shot one down, frustrating the attack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2003/03/25/2003-03-25_iraqis_bash_choppers__one_u_.html |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=IRAQIS BASH CHOPPERS One U.S. copter downed, crew captured by Saddam's guards |date=25 March 2003 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=9 December 2015 <!--DASHBot--> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605020114/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2003/03/25/2003-03-25_iraqis_bash_choppers__one_u_.html |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}</ref> They attacked again successfully on 26 March, this time after a pre-mission artillery barrage and with support from [[F/A-18 Hornet]] jets, with no gunships lost.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/030325-apache01.htm |title=Loss of Apache in Iraq Is Evidence of Vulnerability of Copters to |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=24 March 2003 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref>

The 1st Brigade Combat Team's air defense battery moved in and after heavy fighting with entrenched Iraqi Fedayeen seized a strategic bridge in Najaf, known as "Objective Jenkins". They then came under fierce counterattacks by Iraqi forces and Fedayeen, who failed to dislodge U.S. forces from their positions. After 36 hours of combat at the bridge at Najaf, the Iraqis were defeated, and the key bridge was secured, isolating Najaf from the north.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/onpoint/ch-3.htm#najaf |title=On Point – The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref>

The [[101st Airborne Division]] on 29 March, supported by a battalion from the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], attacked Iraqi forces in the southern part of the city, near the [[Imam Ali Mosque]] and captured Najaf's airfield.<ref name=valorstudios>{{cite web|url=http://www.valorstudios.com/AnNajaf.htm |title="The Battle for An Najaf" by James Dietz |publisher=Valorstudios.com |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703135456/http://www.valorstudios.com/AnNajaf.htm |archivedate=3 July 2007 }}</ref> Four Americans were killed by a [[suicide bomber]].

====Battle of Basra====
{{Main|Battle of Basra (2003)}}
[[File:1 RRF engage Iraqi Army positions with their 81mm Mortars. Iraq. 26-03-2003 MOD 45142764.jpg|thumb|British soldiers engage Iraqi Army positions with their 81mm Mortars south of [[Basra]], 26 March 2003.]]
The Iraqi port city of [[Umm Qasr]] was the first British obstacle. A joint Polish-British-American force ran into unexpectedly stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the [[British 7 Armoured Brigade]] ("The Desert Rats"), fought their way into Iraq's second-largest city, [[Basra]], on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] cleared the 'old quarter' of the city that was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, which included the biggest tank battle by British forces since World War II when the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March.

Elements of [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] began to advance north towards U.S. positions around [[Amarah|Al Amarah]] on 9 April. Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While Coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of [[Umm Qasr]].

After a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near [[Karbala]]. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division's lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad.

A total of 11 British soldiers were killed, while 395–515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed.

===Battle of Karbala===
{{Main|Battle of Karbala (2003)}}
The Karbala Gap was a 20–25-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and [[Lake Razazah]] to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to [[Baghdad]], and was defended by some of the best units of the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]]. The Iraqi high command had originally positioned two [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] divisions blocking the Karbala Gap.<ref name="stripes.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=13572&archive=true |title=Battle through, around Karbala Gap likely to be 'hell of a fight' |work=Stars and Stripes |date=1 April 2003| accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> Here these forces suffered heavy Coalition air attacks. However, the Coalition had since the beginning of March been conducting a strategic deception operation to convince the Iraqis that the U.S. [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] would be mounting a major assault into northern Iraq from Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michael/kelly1.asp#3.%20Across |title=Across the Euphrates |author=Michael Kelly |work=Jewish World Review |date=3 April 2003 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>

This deception plan worked, and on 2 April Saddam's son [[Qusay Hussein]] declared that the American invasion from the south was a feint and ordered troops to be re-deployed from the Karbala front to the north of Baghdad. Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.

The 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed [[Multiple Launch Rocket System|artillery rockets]], destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massed firepower and lost any sense of command and cohesion and the U.S. forces poured through the gap and onward to Baghdad.

In the North, the [[10th Special Forces Group]] (10th SFG) and CIA paramilitary officers from their [[Special Activities Division]] had the mission of aiding the Kurdish parties, the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]], de facto rulers of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] since 1991, and employing them against the 13 Iraqi Divisions located near Kirkuk and Mosul.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony H.

Hours after the first of such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space and the rest of the 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group [[Ansar al-Islam]], believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion.<ref name="Peltier2005"/>

On 26 March 2003, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] augmented the invasion's northern front by parachuting into northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield, controlled at the time by elements of 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga. The fall of Kirkuk on 10 April 2003 to the 10th SFG, CIA Paramilitary Teams and Kurdish peshmerga precipitated the 173rd's planned assault, preventing the unit's involvement in combat against Iraqi forces during the invasion.<ref name="10thSFGand173rdAbnBde">{{cite book|author1=Gregory Fontenot|author2=E.

The successful occupation of Kirkuk came as a result of approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi I Corps.

===Fall of Baghdad (April 2003)===
{{Main|Battle of Baghdad (2003)}}
[[File:DerelictAsadBabil.JPEG|thumb|left|A T72 ''Asad Babil'' abandoned after facing the final U.S. thrust into Baghdad]]

Three weeks into the invasion, [[Multinational force in Iraq|U.S.-led Coalition forces]] moved into [[Baghdad]]. Units of the Iraqi [[Special Republican Guard (Iraq)|Special Republican Guard]] led the defence of the city. The rest of the defenders were a mixture of [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] units, regular army units, [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.

This plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard's assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force 1–64 Armor of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the "Thunder Run", to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the [[Baghdad airport]]. They met heavy resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport. U.S. troops faced heavy fighting in the airport, but eventually secured the airport.

[[File:IrakKriegM1A1USA.jpg|thumb|An American M1 Abrams tank destroyed in Baghdad]]

The next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.

On 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.

[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|The April 2003 [[Firdos Square statue destruction|toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue]] in [[Firdos Square]] in Baghdad shortly after the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|capture of the city]]]]

Many Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his [[cult of personality]]. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time. As the British ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported, {{quote|For an oppressed people this final act in the fading daylight, the wrenching down of this ghastly symbol of the regime, is their [[Berlin Wall]] moment. Big Moustache has had his day."<ref>Anton Antonowicz, "Toppling Saddam's Statue Is The Final Triumph For These Oppressed People", ''The Mirror'', 10 April 2003.</ref>}}

As Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich reported in ''On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom'',

{{quote|The Marine Corps colonel in the area saw the Saddam statue as a target of opportunity and decided that the statue must come down. Since we were right there, we chimed in with some loudspeaker support to let the Iraqis know what it was we were attempting to do...

Somehow along the way, somebody had gotten the idea to put a bunch of Iraqi kids onto the wrecker that was to pull the statue down. While the wrecker was pulling the statue down, there were Iraqi children crawling all over it. Finally they brought the statue down.<ref>Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich, team leader, Tactical Psychological Operations Team 1153, 305th Psychological Operations Company, interview by Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Cahill, 31 May 2003 in [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/onpoint/ch-6.htm Col.

The fall of Baghdad saw the outbreak of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of [[Al-Kut]] and [[Nasiriyah]] launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.
[[File:Grateful Iraqis welcome American Marines during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.ogg|alt=video of US Marines entering the city|US Marines being welcomed while entering Baghdad in April 2003|right|thumb]]
U.S. General [[Tommy Franks]] assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a "safqua") wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba'ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.

U.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein's government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. Later during the [[military occupation]] period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from [[Task Force 20]], Saddam Hussein's sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of [[Task Force 121]] during [[Operation Red Dawn]].

In the north, Kurdish forces opposed to Saddam Hussein had already occupied for years an autonomous area in northern Iraq. With the assistance of U.S. Special Forces and air strikes, they were able to rout the Iraqi units near them and to occupy oil-rich [[Kirkuk]] on 10 April.

U.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to [[Syria]] and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.

On 15 April, U.S. forces took control of [[Tikrit]], the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines' [[Task Force Tripoli]]. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army's 4th Infantry Division.

On 1 May 2003, Bush landed on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}}, in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat operations in the Iraq war. Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as an unnecessarily theatrical and expensive stunt. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating "Mission Accomplished." The banner, made by [[White House]] staff and supplied by request of the United States Navy,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/ |title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |last=Bash |first=Dana |publisher=CNN |date=29 October 2003 |accessdate =21 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715123158/http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/|archivedate=15 July 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> was criticized as premature. The White House subsequently released a statement that the sign and Bush's visit referred to the initial invasion of Iraq and disputing the charge of theatrics.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Operation Telic}}
British troops, in what was codenamed '''Operation''' (or Op) '''TELIC''' participated in the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The 1st Armoured Division was deployed to the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] and commanded British forces in the area, securing areas in southern Iraq, including the city of [[Basra]] during the invasion. A total of 46,000 troops of all the British services were committed to the operation at its start, including some 5,000 [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] sailors and 4,000 [[Royal Marines]], 26,000 [[British Army]] soldiers, and 8,100 [[Royal Air Force]] airmen.

==Summary of the invasion==
[[File:AirForce over Iraq.jpg|thumb|upright|Aircraft of the USAF 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and UK and Australian counterparts stationed together at [[Al Udeid Air Base]], Qatar, in southwest Asia, fly over the desert on 14 April 2003. Aircraft include [[KC-135 Stratotanker]], [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], [[F-117 Nighthawk]], [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16CJ Falcon]], British [[Panavia Tornado|GR-4 Tornado]], and Australian [[F/A-18 Hornet]]]]

The U.S.-led Coalition forces toppled the government and captured the key cities of a large nation in only 21 days. The invasion did require a large army build-up like the 1991 Gulf War, but many did not see combat and many were withdrawn after the invasion ended. This proved to be short-sighted, however, due to the requirement for a much larger force to combat the irregular Iraqi forces in the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|aftermath of the war]]. General [[Eric Shinseki]], U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recommended "several hundred thousand"<ref>Dave Moniz, ''USA TODAY'', 2 June 2003</ref> troops be used to maintain post-war order, but then Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]]—and especially his deputy, civilian [[Paul Wolfowitz]]—strongly disagreed. [[General Abizaid]] later said General Shinseki had been right.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/15/world/americas/15iht-cong.3553734.html |title=Top U.S. general resists calls for pullout from Iraq |work=International Herald Tribune |date=15 November 2006 |first=Brian |last=Knowlton |accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

The Iraqi army, armed mainly with older Soviet and Eastern European built equipment,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas C. Bruneau|author2=Florina Cristiana Matei|title=The Routledge Handbook of Civil-Military Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opJKzPZiADkC&pg=PA139|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-25320-1|pages=139–140}}</ref> was overall ill-equipped in comparison to the American and British forces. Attacks on U.S. [[Main Supply Route|supply routes]] by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis' artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi [[T-72]] tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the Coalition [[air supremacy]]. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British [[Royal Air Force]] operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The [[main battle tank]]s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] and British [[Challenger 2]], functioned well in the rapid advance across the country. Despite the many [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost, and no tank crew-members were killed by hostile fire, although nearly 40 M1 Abrams were damaged in the attacks.<ref>"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, as many as 40 Abrams tanks were damaged by RPGs. Most were repaired." ''Battle Tanks: Power in the Field'', Page 33, Enslow Publishers, 2006</ref> The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the [[Queen's Royal Lancers]] that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members.

The Iraqi army suffered from poor [[morale]], even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent – reports state that [[Qusay Hussein]], charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.

According to the declassified [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report, "The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq's military forces was the continued interference by Saddam." The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam's inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe an invasion was imminent without further Iraqi provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as "chronically out of touch with reality&nbsp;– preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |title=Russia denies Iraq secrets claim |publisher=BBC News|date=25 March 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2006}}</ref>

Estimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely. Estimates on civilian casualties are more variable than those for military personnel. According to [http://www.iraqbodycount.org/ Iraq Body Count], a group that relies on press reports, NGO-based reports and official figures to measure civilian casualties, approximately 7,500 civilians were killed during the invasion phase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqbodycount.org/press/pr12.php|title=Iraq Body Count: A Dossier of Civilian Casualties in Iraq, 2003–2005.|accessdate=2 May 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lAQuuCz8 |archivedate=9 November 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> The Project on Defense Alternatives study estimated that 3,200–4,300 civilians died during the invasion.<ref name="pda" />

After the ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]] during the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March, the bodies of several U.S. soldiers who had been killed in the ambush were shown on Iraqi television. Some of these soldiers had visible gunshot wounds to head, leading to speculation that they had been executed. Except for Sgt. [[Donald Walters]], no evidence has since surfaced to support this scenario and it is generally accepted that the soldiers were killed in action. Five live prisoners of war were also interviewed on the air, a violation of the [[Third Geneva Convention]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/24/1048354495010.html |title=Iraqi TV shows US dead and POWs |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=24 March 2003|accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2003/03/pow_tv.single.html|title=How POW TV violates the Geneva Conventions|work=Slate|accessdate=9 September 2015|deadurl=no|date=March 2003}}</ref> Sergeant Walters was initially reported to have been killed in the ambush after killing several Fedayeen before running out of ammunition.

Also on 23 March, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of [[Az Zubayr]], which was still held by Iraqi forces.

==Security, looting and war damage==
Massive [[looting]] took place in the days following the 2003 invasion.<ref>Johnson, I.M. "The impact on libraries and archives in Iraq of war and looting in 2003 – a preliminary assessment of the damage and subsequent reconstruction efforts". ''International Information and Library Review'', 37 (3), 2005, 209–271.</ref> According to U.S. officials, the "reality of the situation on the ground" was that hospitals, water plants, and ministries with vital intelligence needed security more than other sites. There were only enough U.S. troops on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some "hard choices" were made.

[[File:IraqNationalMuseum.jpg|thumb|A [[M109 howitzer]] guarding the [[National Museum of Iraq]] following the 2003 invasion of Iraq]]

It was reported that the [[National Museum of Iraq]] was among the looted sites. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was soon called into Iraq to track down the stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of stolen pieces at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an "inside job" before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos. Over 5,000 looted items have since been recovered.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/040415/oi.shtml |title=Archaeologists review loss of valuable artifacts one year after looting |first=William |last=Harms |work=The University of Chicago Chronicle |date=15 April 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kLt8HBOo|archivedate=7 October 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> An assertion that U.S. forces did not guard the museum because they were guarding the Ministry of Oil and Ministry of Interior is disputed by investigator Colonel [[Matthew Bogdanos]] in his 2005 book ''Thieves of Baghdad''. Bogdanos notes that the Ministry of Oil building was bombed, but the museum complex, which took some fire, was not bombed. He also writes that Saddam Hussein's troops set up sniper's nests inside and on top of the museum, and nevertheless U.S. Marines and soldiers stayed close enough to prevent wholesale looting.

More serious for the post-war state of Iraq was the looting of cached weaponry and ordnance which fueled the subsequent insurgency. As many as 250,000&nbsp;tons of explosives were unaccounted for by October 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6323933 |title=Pentagon: Some explosives possibly destroyed |agency=Associated Press |date=29 October 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706102723/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6323933|archivedate=6 July 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> Disputes within the [[US Department of Defense|US Defense Department]] led to delays in the post-invasion assessment and protection of Iraqi nuclear facilities.

At the start of the war in March 2003, as many as 775 reporters and photographers were traveling as [[embedded journalists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/03/15_mediatwar.shtml|title=Reporters, commentators visit Berkeley to conduct in-depth postmortem of Iraq war coverage|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5Qa2JANrq |archivedate=24 July 2007|deadurl=no}}</ref> These reporters signed contracts with the military that limited what they were allowed to report on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june03/embed_3-27.html|title=Pros and Cons of Embedded Journalism|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5QZmMSZE3 |archivedate=24 July 2007|deadurl=no}}</ref> When asked why the military decided to embed journalists with the troops, Lt.

In 2003, a study released by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] stated the network news disproportionately focused on pro-war sources and left out many [[anti-war]] sources. According to the study, 64% of total sources were in favor of the Iraq War while total anti-war sources made up 10% of the media (only 3% of US sources were anti-war). The study looked only at 6 American news networks after 20 March for three weeks. The study stated that "viewers were more than six times as likely to see a pro-war source as one who was anti-war; with U.S. guests alone, the ratio increases to 25 to 1."<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Steve Rendall  |author2=Tara Broughel|year=2003 |title=Amplifying Officials, Squelching Dissent |journal=Extra!|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1145 |accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

===Independent media coverage===
[[Independent media]] also played a prominent role in covering the invasion. The [[Indymedia]] network, among many other independent networks including many journalists from the invading countries, provided reports on the Iraq war. In the United States [[Democracy Now]], hosted by [[Amy Goodman]] has been critical of the reasons for the 2003 invasion and the alleged crimes committed by the U.S. authorities in Iraq.

The [[Israeli Military Censor]] have released gag orders to Fresh and Rotter news platforms preventing them releasing any information about events and action related to the invasion.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/news/2003/03/is031903.html Censorship instructions - American Attack on Iraq], fas.org</ref>

On the other side, among media not opposing to the invasion, ''[[The Economist]]'' stated in an article on the matter that "the normal diplomatic tools—sanctions, persuasion, pressure, UN resolutions—have all been tried, during 12 deadly but failed years" then giving a mild conditional support to the war stating that "if Mr Hussein refuses to disarm, it would be right to go to war".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1592539 |title=Dealing with Saddam Hussein&nbsp;– Why war would be justified |work=The Economist |date=20 February 2003|accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Australian [[war artist]] [[George Gittoes]] collected independent interviews with soldiers while producing his documentary ''[[Soundtrack To War]]''. The war in Iraq provided the first time in history that military on the front lines were able to provide direct, uncensored reportage themselves, thanks to blogging software and the reach of the internet. Dozens of such reporting sites, known as [[Warblog|soldier blogs]] or milblogs, were started during the war. These blogs were more often than not largely pro-war and stated various reasons why the soldiers and Marines felt they were doing the right thing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1543658,00.html |title=The Secret Letter From Iraq |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=6 October 2006 |accessdate=1 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907022521/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1543658,00.html|archivedate=7 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===International media coverage===
International coverage of the war differed from coverage in the U.S. in a number of ways.
The Arab-language news channel [[Al Jazeera]] and the German satellite channel [[Deutsche Welle]] featured almost twice as much information on the political background of the war.<ref>[http://www.agendasetting.com/newsletter/ICA.pdf International comparison of TV news coverage of Iraq]. {{wayback|url=http://www.agendasetting.com/newsletter/ICA.pdf |date=20120229191158 |df=y }}</ref> Al Jazeera also showed scenes of civilian casualties which were rarely seen in the U.S. media.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of the Iraq War}}
Opponents of military intervention in Iraq have attacked the decision to invade Iraq along a number of lines, including calling into question the [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Rationale|evidence]] used to justify the war, arguing for continued diplomacy, challenging the war's [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Legality of invasion|legality]], suggesting that the U.S. had other more pressing security priorities, (i.e., Afghanistan and [[North Korea]]) and predicting that the war would destabilize the Middle East region. The breadth and depth of the criticism was particularly notable in comparison with the first Gulf War, which met with considerably less domestic and international opposition, although the geopolitical situation had evolved since the last decade.

===Rationale based on faulty evidence===
The central U.S. justification for launching the Iraq War was that Saddam Hussein's alleged development of nuclear and biological weapons and purported ties to al-Qaeda made his regime a "grave and growing"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020912-1.html|title=President's Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly, 12 September 2002|accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> threat to the United States and the world community.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.transcript/index.html |title=Transcript of Powell's U.N. presentation |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=6 February 2003 |accessdate=6 April 2007}}</ref> During the lead-up to the war and the aftermath of the invasion, critics cast doubt on the evidence supporting this rationale. Concerning Iraq's weapons programs, prominent critics included [[Scott Ritter]], a former U.N. weapons inspector who argued in 2002 that inspections had eliminated the nuclear and chemical weapons programs, and that evidence of their reconstitution would "have been eminently detectable by intelligence services ..." Although it is popularly believed{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} that Saddam Hussein had forced the IAEA weapons inspectors to leave Iraq, they were in fact withdrawn at the request of US Ambassador Peter Burleigh in advance of [[Operation Desert Fox]], the 1998 American bombing campaign. After the build-up of U.S. troops in neighboring states, Hussein welcomed them back and promised complete cooperation with their demands. Experienced IAEA inspection teams were already back in Iraq and had made some interim reports on its search for various forms of WMD.<ref>{{cite news |date=7 March 2003 |title=Mission Possible: Nuclear Weapons Inspections in Iraq |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebWSJ20030307.shtml |first=Dr. Mohamed |last=ElBaradei |authorlink=Mohamed ElBaradei |publisher=[[IAEA]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iSuch7sh|archivedate=22 July 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=14 February 2003 |title=The Status of Nuclear Inspections in Iraq: 14 February 2003 Update |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebsp2003n005.shtml |first=Dr. Mohamed |last=ElBaradei |authorlink=Mohamed ElBaradei |publisher=[[IAEA]]|accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Hans |last=Blix |authorlink1=Hans Blix |first2=Dr. Mohamed |last2=ElBaradei |authorlink2=Mohamed ElBaradei |title=Transcript of Hans Blix Feb. 9, 2003, press conference |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/IaeaIraq/pressconf_09022003.pdf |format=PDF |date=9 February 2003 |publisher=[[IAEA]] |accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107164040/http://iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/IaeaIraq/pressconf_09022003.pdf |archivedate=7 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IAEA Media Advisory 2003/1003 |date=10 March 2003 |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/MediaAdvisory/2003/ma_iraq_1003.shtml |publisher=[[IAEA]]|accessdate=29 October 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=[[The Capital Times]] |title=Media Miss War Dissent in Congress |date=6 February 2003 |url=http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2003/02/06/0302060078.php |page=12A |first=John |last=Nichols|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iSue4wW4|archivedate=22 July 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=19 July 2009}}</ref> American diplomat [[Joseph C.

Similarly, alleged links between Iraq and al-Qaeda were called into question during the lead-up to the war, and were discredited by a 21 October 2004 report from U.S. Senator [[Carl Levin]], which was later corroborated by an April 2006 report from the Defense Department’s inspector general.<ref>Jehl, Douglas.

===Lack of a U.N. mandate===
One of the main questions in the lead-up to the war was whether the [[United Nations Security Council]] would authorize military intervention in Iraq. It became increasingly clear that U.N. authorization would require significant further weapons inspections. Many criticized their effort as unwise, immoral, and illegal. [[Robin Cook]], then the leader of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom House of Commons]] and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blair's cabinet in protest over the UK’s decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution. Cook said at the time that: "In principle I believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support. In practice I believe it is against Britain's interests to create a precedent for unilateral military action."<ref>Tempest, Matthew.

In addition, senior government legal advisor [[Elizabeth Wilmshurst]] resigned, stating her legal opinion that an invasion would be illegal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] said in an interview with the BBC in September 2004, "[F]rom our point of view and from the Charter point of view [the war] was illegal."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661640.stm|title=Excerpts: Annan interview|date=16 September 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 August 2007}}</ref> This drew immediate criticism from the United States and was immediately played down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25685-2004Sep16.html|title=U.S., Allies Dispute Annan on Iraq War|first=Colum|last=Lynch|work=Washington Post|date=17 September 2004|page=A18|accessdate=25 May 2006}}</ref> His annual report to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] for 2003 included no more than the statement: "Following the end of major hostilities which resulted in the occupation of Iraq..."<ref name="UN_A581">{{UN document |docid=A-58-1 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=58 |page=9 |accessdate=8 August 2007|date=28 August 2003}}</ref> A similar report from the Security Council was similarly terse in its reference to the event: "Following the cessation of hostilities in Iraq in April 2003 ..."<ref name="UN_A582">{{UN document |docid=A-58-2 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=58 |page=20 |accessdate=8 August 2007|date=23 September 2003}}</ref> The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|678]], passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes "member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means" to (1) implement Security Council Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 660|660]] and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) "restore international peace and security in the area."

===Military intervention vs diplomatic solution===
{{Wikisource|French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council}}
Criticisms about the evidence used to justify the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], who responded to U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]]'s 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: "Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspections."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.world.reax/ "Nations take sides after Powell's speech"] {{wayback|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.world.reax/ |date=20080308161802 |df=y }}.

(...) Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with all the members of the international community.

[[Francophobia|Anti-French propaganda]] exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the [[Anti-French sentiment in the United States|United States]] and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the ''[[New York Post]]'' covered on the 1944 "Sacrifice" of the [[GI (military)|GIs]] France would had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' publishing a special issue entitled "Chirac is a worm" and including ''ad hominem'' attacks such as "Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe".<ref name="ina.fr-20030220">[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from=fulltext&full=ankara&num_notice=3&total_notices=12 20 heures le journal : émission du 20 février 2003 (National Audiovisual Institute archives)], French news national edition, France 2 French public channel, 20 February 2003</ref> Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire [[Rupert Murdoch]], a military intervention supporter and a George W.

===Distraction from the war on terrorism and other priorities===
Both supporters and opponents of the Iraq War widely viewed it within the context of a post–[[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September]] world, where the U.S. has sought to make terrorism the defining international security paradigm. Bush often described the Iraq War as a "central front in the [[war on terror]]".<ref>Office of the Press Secretary. [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050628-7.html President Addresses Nation, Discusses Iraq, War on Terror"]. White House Press Release, 28 June 2005. Retrieved on 17 April 2007.</ref> Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda. As Marine Lieutenant General [[Greg Newbold]], the Pentagon's former top operations officer, wrote in a 2006 ''TIME'' article, "I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat—al-Qaeda."<ref>Newbold, Greg. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1181629,00.html "Why Iraq Was a Mistake".] ''Time'', 9 April 2006. Retrieved on 16 April 2007.</ref>

Critics within this vein have further argued that containment would have been an effective strategy for the Hussein government, and that the top U.S. priorities in the Middle East should be encouraging a solution to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], working for the moderation of [[Iran]], and solidifying gains made in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and Central Asia. In an October 2002 speech, Retired Marine Gen. [[Anthony Zinni]], former head of [[United States Central Command|Central Command]] for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department's envoy to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, called Iraq "maybe six or seven," in terms of U.S. Middle East priorities, adding that "the affordability line may be drawn around five."<ref>Boehlert, Eric. [http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/10/17/zinni/index.html?pn=1 "I'm not sure which planet they live on"]. ''Salon'', 17 October 20002. Retrieved 17 April 2007.</ref> However, while commander of CENTCOM, Zinni held a very different opinion concerning the threat posed by Iraq. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2000, Zinni said: "Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR), persistent threats to enforcement of the No Fly Zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2000/000229az.pdf |title=Statement of General Anthony C.

===Potential to destabilize the region===
Besides arguing that Iraq was not the top strategic priority in the war on terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was [[Brent Scowcroft]], who served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] to [[George H. W. Bush]]. In a 15&nbsp;August 2002 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial entitled "Don't attack [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]]", Scowcroft wrote that, "Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region ... there would be an explosion of outrage against us ... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes", and, "could even swell the ranks of the terrorists."<ref>Scowcroft, Brent.

Members of the Saddam Hussein government were called by disparaging nicknames – e.g., "Chemical Ali" ([[Ali Hassan al-Majid]]), "Baghdad Bob" or "Comical Ali" ([[Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf]]), and "Mrs. Anthrax" or "Chemical Sally" ([[Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash]]).

Terminology introduced or popularized during the war include:
* "[[Axis of evil]]", originally used by Bush during a [[State of the Union]] address on 29 January 2002 to refer to the countries of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html |title=The President's State of the Union Address|date=29 January 2002 |accessdate=21 July 2006}}</ref>
* "[[Coalition of the willing]]", a term that originated in the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] era (e.g., interview, Clinton, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], 8 June 1994), and used by the Bush Administration for the countries contributing troops in the invasion, of which the U.S. and UK were the primary members.
* "[[Decapitation|Decapitating]] the regime", a euphemism for killing Saddam Hussein.
* "[[Embedded journalist|Embedding]]", United States practice of assigning civilian journalists to U.S. military units.
* "[[Freedom fries]]", a euphemism for [[French fries]] invented to protest the non-participation of [[France]]
* "[[Mother of all bombs]]", a bomb developed and produced to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. Its name echoes Saddam's phrase "Mother of all battles" to describe the first [[Gulf War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2080106/ |title=Meet the Air Force's 'palace buster.' |accessdate=21 September 2009 |last=Kaplan |first=Fred |date=13 March 2003 |publisher=MSN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20050826002400/http://slate.msn.com:80/id/2080106/ |archivedate=26 August 2005 }}</ref>
* "[[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]]", Rumsfeld's term for European governments not supporting the war: "You're thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I don't. I think that's old Europe."
* "[[Regime change]]", a euphemism for overthrowing a government.
* "[[Shock and Awe]]", the strategy of reducing an enemy's will to fight through displays of overwhelming force.

Many slogans and terms coined came to be used by Bush's political opponents, or those opposed to the war. For example, in April 2003 [[John Kerry]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate in the [[2004 United States Presidential Election|presidential election]], said at a campaign rally: "What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23490-2003Apr3 |last=Balz |first=Dan |title=Kerry Angers GOP in Calling For 'Regime Change' in U.S. |work=Washington Post |page=A10|date=3 April 2003 |accessdate=21 July 2006}}{{Dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> Other war critics use the name "Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL)" to subtly point out their opinion as to the cause of the war, such as the song "Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL)" by [[David Rovics]], a popular folk protest singer.
