He initially gained recognition for being one-half of the [[Southern hip hop]] duo [[Playaz Circle]], alongside his longtime friend and fellow rapper, Earl "Dolla Boy" Conyers. They are perhaps best known for being signed to fellow Georgia-based rapper [[Ludacris]]' [[Disturbing tha Peace]] label, as well as their debut single "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]".

In February 2012, Epps signed a solo [[record deal]] with [[Def Jam Records]], an imprint of [[Universal Music Group]]. The following August, he released his debut studio album ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]]'', to mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/based-on-a-tru-story/2-chainz/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Based on a T.R.U.

His second studio album ''[[B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time]]'' was released on September 11, 2013. It was supported by the singles "[[Feds Watching]]", "[[Where U Been?]]", and "[[Used 2]]".

==Musical career==

===1997–2010: Playaz Circle and Disturbing tha Peace===
Epps formed the hip hop duo [[Playaz Circle]] (the word "Playaz" being a [[bacronym]] for "Preparing Legal Assets for Years from A to Z")<ref name=dubmagazine>{{cite web|title=Playaz Circle|url=http://dubmagazine.com/stars/musicians/410-playaz-circle|work=Dub Magazine|publisher=Dub Publishing |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> in [[College Park, Georgia]] in 1997, with his high school friend Earl Conyers (known as Dolla Boy), while Epps adopted "Tity Boi" as his [[moniker]].<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web |last=Cordor|first=Cyril|title=Playaz Circle – Biography|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/playaz-circle-p733429/biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> Following the release of an [[Independent music|independent album]] titled ''United We Stand, United We Fall'' (2002),<ref name=dubmagazine/> the duo were introduced to fellow Atlanta rapper [[Ludacris]], when he moved into their College Park apartment complex, whilst he was acting as a [[disc jockey|DJ]].<ref name=allmusicbio/> After taking interest in Playaz Circle, Ludacris began to record several songs with the group, playing some of them on his [[radio station]].<ref name=dubmagazine/>

Ludacris soon became one of the highest-selling rappers in the [[Southern United States]].<ref name=allmusicbio/> After hearing of their situation, Ludacris requested of Epps that the duo join his newly formed record label [[Disturbing Tha Peace]], a subsidiary of [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Epps agreed to sign, although Conyers did not officially join the label until his mother regained her health, a year after the initial signing.<ref name=allmusicbio/>

Their debut album ''[[Supply & Demand (Playaz Circle album)|Supply & Demand]]'', was released on October 30, 2007. The [[lead single]] and their debut single, "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]", became an urban [[hit single]]. The song features [[Lil Wayne]], and was performed by the duo at the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. The duo released their second studio album ''[[Flight 360: The Takeoff]]'', on September 29, 2009. In January 2010, Playaz Circle filmed a music video for their single "Big Dawg" [[featuring]] Lil Wayne and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] at Studio Space Atlanta. Shortly afterwards, Epps left Disturbing tha Peace, a move he claimed was taken in order to advance his career. Although Ludacris was initially reluctant to allow Epps to leave the label (as he felt Epps could still prove financially successful), he eventually accepted the decision.<ref name=albumtitle>{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Andres|title=2 Chainz Reveals Album Title, Speaks On Leaving Ludacris' Label|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19019/title.2-chainz-reveals-album-title-speaks-on-leaving-ludacris-label|work=HipHopDX|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=May 20, 2012|date=March 15, 2012}}</ref>

===2011–12: Name change and ''Based on a T.R.U. Story''===
Throughout Epps' career, critics and fans alike have speculated the [[pseudonym]] "Tity Boi" was meant to be derogatory towards women, although he repeatedly denied such accusations.<ref name=vibenamechange>{{cite web|title=2 Chainz Opens Up About Why He Was Named 'Tity Boi', T.R.U.

On June 11, 2013, Epps was arrested while on board a departing flight at [[LAX]] airport for possession of a controlled substance after TSA agents found that his checked bag contained [[marijuana]] and [[promethazine]]. He was booked and charged with [[felony]] narcotics possession. Later that day he posted $10,000 bond and was released. He was due back in court on June 21, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/06/2-chainz-arrested-in-lax-for-possession-of-marijuana-and-promethazine/ |title=2 Chainz Arrested In LAX For Possession Of Marijuana And Promethazine – XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref>
Two days previous, he was reportedly robbed at gunpoint outside a [[medical marijuana]] dispensary in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rapper 2 Chainz robbed outside S.F. marijuana dispensary|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2013/06/10/rapper-2-chainz-robbed-outside-s-f-marijuana-dispensary/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=SFGate.com|accessdate=June 27, 2013|date=June 10, 2013}}</ref>

Just before midnight on August 21, 2013, Epps' tour bus was pulled over in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], because the passenger side taillights were out.  The arresting officer reported that he smelled marijuana and saw smoke through the open door of the bus after he had stopped and pulled over the bus. The driver of the bus shut the door and told officers he was not authorized to allow them on the bus. The officer said the [[marijuana]] smell gave him probable cause to search, but the driver refused to open the door. After many attempts to enter, the bus was towed with the men still aboard to the police training center in Oklahoma City. Officers obtained a search warrant and the 10 men, including Epps, got off the bus. Police discovered two semi-automatic pistols and a 12-gauge pump shotgun, along with some prescription painkillers and marijuana residue, on the tour bus according to papers filed [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]] District Court.<ref>{{cite web|author=MICHAEL MCNUTT mmcnutt@opubco.com &bull; |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-police-found-weapons-painkillers-on-rappers-tour-bus-court-papers-show/article/3878935 |title=Oklahoma City police found weapons, painkillers on rapper's tour bus, court papers show |publisher=News OK |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref>
