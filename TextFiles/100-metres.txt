The '''100&nbsp;metres''', or '''100-meter dash''', is a [[sprint (running)|sprint race]] in [[track and field]] competitions. The shortest common outdoor running distance, it is one of the most popular and prestigious [[athletics events|events]] in the [[sport of athletics]]. It has been contested at the [[Summer Olympics]] since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women.
[[File:Women's 100M Final - 28th Summer Universiade 2015 Gwangju.webm|thumbnail|Women's 100M Final - 28th Summer Universiade 2015]]
The reigning [[100 metres at the Olympics|100&nbsp;m Olympic champion]] is often named "the fastest man in the world." The [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championships 100 metres]] has been contested since 1983. Jamaicans [[Usain Bolt]] and [[Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]] are the reigning [[World Championships in Athletics|world]] and [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] champions in the men's and women's 100 metres, respectively.

On an outdoor [[400 metres]] [[running track]], the 100&nbsp;m is run on the [[home straight]], with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. Runners begin in the [[starting blocks]] and the race begins when an official fires the [[starter's pistol]]. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50–60&nbsp;m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.

The [[10-second barrier]] has historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men's [[List of world records in athletics|world record]] is 9.58&nbsp;seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record of 10.49&nbsp;seconds set by American [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] in 1988 remains unbroken.

The 100&nbsp;m (109.361 yards) emerged from the metrication of the [[100-yard dash|100&nbsp;yards]] (91.44 m), a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries. The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100&nbsp;m straight.

==Race dynamics==

===Start===
[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|right|Male sprinters await the starter's instructions]]

At the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the [[starting blocks]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=g2apWjFFg94C&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=%22starting+blocks%22+gamesmanship&source=bl&ots=0DbOc_jtZ9&sig=7wZD_prKQOUvFtC3rDYLx3-WMNk&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22starting%20blocks%22%20gamesmanship&f=false BTEC First Sport By Bob Harris, R. Mills, S. Parker-Bennet]</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830123&id=uwMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1446,4230157 The Day – 23 January 1983]</ref><ref>http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893</ref>

At high level meets, the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically, via sensors built in the gun and the blocks. A reaction time less than 0.1&nbsp;s is considered a [[false start]]. The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter's pistol to reach the runners' ears, and the time they take to react to it.

For many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually. However, this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus. The next iteration of the rule, introduced in February 2003, meant that one false start was allowed among the field, but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified.

This rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage: an individual with a slower [[reaction time]] might false-start, forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start, thereby losing some of their advantage. To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment, the [[IAAF]] implemented a further change in the 2010 season – a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification.<ref>{{cite news |title=IAAF keeps one false-start rule |publisher=BBC  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/4433815.stm |accessdate=15 August 2008 | date=3 August 2005}}</ref> This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005, on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes. [[Justin Gatlin]] commented, "Just a flinch or a leg cramp could cost you a year's worth of work."<ref>{{cite news |title=Gatlin queries false start change |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/4521963.stm |accessdate=15 August 2008 |work=BBC News  | date=6 May 2005}}</ref> The rule had a dramatic impact at the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics|2011 World Championships]], when current world record holder Usain Bolt was disqualified.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who Can Beat Bolt in the 100?

===Mid-race===
Runners normally reach their top speed just past the halfway point of the race and they progressively decelerate in the later stages of the race. Maintaining that top speed for as long as possible is a primary focus of training for the 100&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speedendurance.com/2008/08/22/usain-bolt-100m-10-meter-splits-and-speed-endurance/ |title=Usain Bolt 100m 10 meter Splits and Speed Endurance |publisher=Speedendurance.com |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> [[Pace (speed)|Pacing]] and running tactics do not play a significant role in the 100&nbsp;m, as success in the event depends more on pure athletic qualities and technique.

===Finish===
The winner, by IAAF Competition Rules, is determined by the first athlete with his or her [[torso]] (not including limbs, head, or neck) over the nearer edge of the finish line.<ref>{{cite web |title=IAAF Competition Rules 2009, Rule 164 |publisher=IAAF |url=http://www.goldenleague.net/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/04/95/59/20090303014358_httppostedfile_CompetitionRules2009_printed_8986.pdf |accessdate=23 August 2009|author=Sandre-Tom <!-i- BOT GENERATED AUTHOR -->|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jWCCLDoE|archivedate=3 September 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> When the placing of the athletes is not obvious, a [[photo finish]] is used to distinguish which runner was first to cross the line.

===Climatic conditions===
{{see also|wind assistance}}

Climatic conditions, in particular air resistance, can affect performances in the 100 m. A strong head wind is very detrimental to performance, while a tail wind can improve performances significantly. For this reason, a maximum tail wind of 2.0&nbsp;m/s is allowed for a 100&nbsp;m performance to be considered eligible for records, or "wind legal."

Furthermore, sprint athletes perform better at high altitudes because of the thinner air, which provides less air resistance. In theory, the thinner air would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen being lower), but this difference is negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash is already in the muscles and bloodstream when the race starts (explaining why many athletes choose not to breathe for the duration of the race){{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000&nbsp;m above sea level are marked with an "A."<ref name=IAAF>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4666.html 100 metres] IAAF</ref>

===Gender and ethnicity===
{{main|race and sports}}

Only male sprinters have beaten the 100&nbsp;m [[10-second barrier]], nearly all of them being of West African descent. [[Namibia]]n (formerly [[South-West Africa]]) [[Frankie Fredericks]] became the first man of non-West African heritage to achieve the feat in 1991 and in 2003 Australia's [[Patrick Johnson (sprinter)|Patrick Johnson]] (who has Irish and [[Indigenous Australian]] heritage) became the first sub-10-second runner without an African background.<ref>Will Swanton and David Sygall, (2007-07-15).

In the [[Prefontaine Classic]] 2015 Diamond League meet at [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Su Bingtian]] ran a time of 9.99 seconds, becoming the first Asian athlete to officially break the 10-second barrier. In the 2015 Birmingham Grand Prix Diamond League meet, British athlete [[Adam Gemili]], who is of mixed [[Iran]]ian and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] descent, ran a time of 9.97 seconds on home soil, becoming the first athlete with either North African or Middle Eastern heritage to break the ten-second barrier.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/33041325</ref>  Of the six men's continental record holders, currently three of them were born in Nigeria.

It is believed that biological factors may be largely responsible for the notable success in sprinting events enjoyed by athletes of West African descent. 
This includes:<ref>http://www.jonentine.com/pdf/PhilofSport_Taboo_Entine.pdf</ref>

Relatively less subcutaneous fat on arms and legs and proportionately more lean body and muscle mass, broader shoulders, larger quadriceps, and bigger, more developed musculature in general;

Denser, shallower chests;

Higher center of gravity, generally shorter sitting height, narrower hips, and lighter calves;

Longer arm span and "distal elongation of segments" – the hand is relatively longer than the forearm, which in turn is relatively longer than the upper arm; the foot is relatively longer than the tibia (leg), which is relatively longer than the thigh;

Faster patellar tendon reflex;

Greater body density, which is likely due to higher bone mineral density and heavier bone mass at all stages in life, including infancy (despite evidence of lower calcium intake and a higher prevalence of lactose intolerance, which prevents consumption of dairy products);

Modestly, but significantly, higher levels of plasma testosterone (3–19 per cent), which is anabolic, theoretically contributing to greater muscle mass, lower fat, and the ability to perform at a higher level of intensity with quicker recovery;

The [[ACTN3]] protein, a "speed gene" most common among persons of West African descent that renders fast twitch muscle fibers fast. [[African American]] 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m world champion [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] has suggested that the presence of ACTN3 is at the root of the success of these athletes in sprinting events;<ref name="Tdojwsgl">{{cite news|last=Entine|first=Jon|title=The DNA Olympics -- Jamaicans Win Sprinting 'Genetic Lottery' -- and Why We Should All Care|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/08/12/the-dna-olympics-jamaicans-win-sprinting-genetic-lottery-and-why-we-should-all-care/|accessdate=19 July 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=8 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="Wmarstttsu">{{cite news|last=Demirel|first=Evin|title=What Made Arkansas’ Record-Setting 2012 Track Team So Unique|url=http://thesportsseer.com/2012/08/08/what-made-arkansas-record-setting-2012-track-team-so-unique/|accessdate=19 July 2013|newspaper=The Sports Seer|date=8 August 2012}}</ref>

And finally, a higher percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers (Type II) and more anaerobic enzymes, which can translate into more explosive energy.
The [[enzyme]] [[creatine kinase]] is abundantly expressed in these fibers. The enzyme rapidly regenerates the biological fuel molecule [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] needed for the sprint. The enzyme has been reported to be twice as high in subjects of sub-Saharan African descent.<ref>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032471</ref> Creatine kinase is the final common pathway of muscle activity. It is tightly bound to the muscle fibers and directly fuels fast muscle contraction. Therefore, the creatine kinase system is considered to be the major factor, downstream of other factors, that modulates the biological capacity to sprint.<ref>http://sjss-sportsacademy.edu.rs/archive/details/full/muscle-metabolism-and-fatigue-during-sprint-exercise-effects-of-creatine-supplementation-11.html</ref>

Top sprinters of differing ancestry, such as Christophe Lemaitre, are believed to be exceptions in that they too likely have the genes favourable for sprinting.<ref name="Wmarstttsu"/>

==Record performances==
Major 100&nbsp;m races, such as at the Olympic Games, attract much attention, particularly when the world record is thought to be within reach.

The men's world record has been improved upon twelve times since [[fully automatic time|electronic timing]] became mandatory in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|agency=Associated Press|title=Progression of 100 meters world record|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=2442751|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref> The current men's world record of 9.58&nbsp;s is held by [[Usain Bolt]] of Jamaica, set at the 2009 World Athletics Championships final on 16 August 2009, breaking his own previous world record by 0.11&nbsp;s.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Metres Results|url=http://berlin.iaaf.org/documents/pdf/3658/AT-100-M-f--1--.RS1.pdf|publisher=[[IAAF]]|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref> The current women's world record of 10.49&nbsp;s was set by [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] of the US, at the [[1988 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|1988 United States Olympic Trials]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on 16 July 1988.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/toplists/inout=o/age=n/season=0/sex=W/all=y/legal=A/disc=100/detail.html 100 Metres All Time].

Some records have been marred by prohibited drug use – in particular, the scandal at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] when the winner, Canadian [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] was stripped of his medal and world record.

[[Jim Hines]], [[Ronnie Ray Smith]] and [[Charles Greene (athlete)|Charles Green]] were the first to break the [[10-second barrier]] in the 100&nbsp;m, all on 20 June 1968, the [[Night of Speed]]. Hines also recorded the first legal electronically timed sub-10 second 100&nbsp;m in winning the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics|100 metres at the 1968 Olympics]].

* [[Usain Bolt]] also holds the record for the fastest 100 metres with a running start at 8.70 (41&nbsp;km/h). This was achieved during a 150 metres race in Manchester 2009, completed in 14.35 (also a World Record).
* [[Tyson Gay]] ran a time of 9.68&nbsp;s set on 29 June 2008 during the 2008 U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials at [[Hayward Field]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], but the tail wind speed was +4.1&nbsp;m/s, more than double the IAAF legal limit of +2.0&nbsp;m/s.<ref>Zinser, Lynn (30 June 2008), [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/sports/olympics/30track.html?hp "Shattering Limits on the Track, and in the Pool"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>
* [[Obadele Thompson]] ran 9.69 in [[El Paso, Texas]] in April 1996, which stood as the fastest ever 100m time for 12 years until Tyson Gay's June 2008 performance, but the tail wind speed was +5.7&nbsp;m/s.
*  [[Andre De Grasse]] of Markham, Ontario, Canada, ran 9.75 s on June 12, 2015, during the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in Eugene, Oregon, U.S.A, but the tail wind speed was +2.7&nbsp;m/s.
* [[Justin Gatlin]] ran 9.77 in Doha on 12 May 2006, which was at the time ratified as a world record. However, the record was rescinded in 2007 after he failed a doping test in April 2006.
* [[Carl Lewis]] ran a time of 9.78 seconds at the 1988 US Olympic trials in Indianapolis, but the tail wind speed was +5.2&nbsp;m/s.
* [[Tim Montgomery]]'s time of 9.78 at Paris on 14 September 2002 was rescinded following his indictment in the [[BALCO]] scandal on drug use and drug trafficking charges. The time had stood as the world record until Asafa Powell first ran 9.77.
* [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] ran 9.79 at Seoul on 24 September 1988, but he was disqualified after he tested positive for [[stanozolol]] after the race. He subsequently admitted to drug use between 1981 and 1988, and his time of 9.83 at Rome on 30 August 1987 was rescinded. Carl Lewis's 9.92 in the Seoul race was therefore recognized as the world record, and his two prior runs of 9.93 were seen as having equalled the previous world record.
* [[Ato Boldon]] ran four 9.86 races (two in 1998, two in 1999).
*[[Dwain Chambers]] time of 9.87 (+2.0) on 14 September 2002 in Paris was later annulled due to doping offense.
* [[Steve Mullings]] is serving a lifetime ban for doping.

====More facts about these female runners====

* [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]]'s World Record has been the subject of a controversy due to strong suspicion of a defective [[anemometer]] measuring a tailwind lower than actually present;<ref>{{cite web|author=Pritchard, W.

Her 10.61 the following day and 10.62 at the 1988 Olympics would still make her the world record holder.<ref>http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/toplists/inout=o/age=n/season=0/sex=W/all=y/legal=A/disc=100/detail.html</ref>
