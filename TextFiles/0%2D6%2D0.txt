[[File:UP 4466 Neil916.JPG|thumb|300px|Union Pacific 4466, on display at the [[California State Railroad Museum]] in [[Sacramento, California]].]]Under the [[Whyte notation]] for the classification of [[steam locomotive]]s, '''{{nowrap|0-6-0}}''' represents the [[wheel arrangement]] of no [[leading wheel]]s, six powered and coupled [[driving wheel]]s on three axles, and no [[trailing wheel]]s. This was the most common wheel arrangement used on both [[Tender (rail)|tender]] and [[tank locomotive]]s, in versions with both [[Cylinder (locomotive)|inside and outside cylinders]].

In Britain the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod coupled driving wheels.<ref>[[:en:Whyte notation#Internal combustion locomotives|Whyte notation]]</ref>

Other equivalent classifications are:
* [[UIC classification]]: '''C''' (also known as [[German classification|German]] and [[Italian classification]]s)
* [[French classification]]: '''030'''
* [[Turkish classification]]: '''33'''
* [[Swiss classification]]: '''3/3'''
* Russian classification: '''0-3-0'''

In the [[UIC classification]] popular in [[Europe]], the same arrangement is written as '''C''' if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears, or '''Co''' if they are independently driven.

==Overview==

===History===
The 0-6-0 configuration was the most widely used [[wheel arrangement]] for both [[Tender (rail)|tender]] and [[tank locomotive|tank]] steam locomotives. The type was also widely used for diesel [[switcher|switchers (shunters)]]. Because they lack [[leading wheel|leading]] and [[trailing wheel]]s, locomotives of this type have all their weight pressing down on their [[driving wheel]]s and consequently have a high [[tractive effort]] and [[factor of adhesion]], making them comparatively strong engines for their size, weight and fuel consumption. On the other hand, the lack of unpowered leading wheels have the result that 0-6-0 locomotives are less stable at speed, so they are mostly used on trains where high speed is unnecessary.

Since 0-6-0 tender engines can pull fairly heavy trains, albeit slowly, the type was commonly used to pull short and medium distance [[Freight rail transport|freight]] trains such as pickup goods trains along both [[main line (railway)|main]] and [[branch line]]s. The tank engine versions were widely used as [[switcher|switching]] ([[shunter|shunting]]) locomotives since the smaller [[0-4-0]] types were not large enough to be versatile in this job. [[0-8-0]] and larger switching locomotives, on the other hand, were too big to be economical or even usable on lightly built railways such as [[dockyard]]s and [[goods yard]]s, precisely the sorts of places where switching locomotives were most needed.

The earliest 0-6-0 locomotives had outside cylinders, as these were simpler to construct and maintain. However, once designers began to overcome the problem of the breakage of the crank axles, inside cylinder versions were found to be more stable. Thereafter this pattern was widely adopted, particularly in the UK, although outside cylinder versions were also widely used.

Tank engine versions of the type began to be built in the mid-1850s and by the mid-1860s had become very common.<ref>Bertram Baxter, ''British locomotive catalogue 1825-1923,'' Vol.1, Moorland Publishing, 1977.</ref>

===Early examples===
[[File:Hackworth's 'Royal George', 1827 (British Railway Locomotives 1803-1853).jpg|right|thumb|Hackworth's Royal George, 1827.]]0-6-0 locomotives were among the first types to be used. The earliest recorded example was the 'Royal George' built by [[Timothy Hackworth]] for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.

Other early examples included the 'Vulcan', the first inside-cylinder type, built by [[Charles Tayleur and Company]] in 1835 for the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]], and 'Hector', a [[Long Boiler locomotive]] built by [[Kitson and Company]] in 1845 for the [[York and North Midland Railway]].<ref>The Science Museum, ''The British railway locomotive 1803-1850'', H.M.S.O., 1958.</ref>

[[Derwent (locomotive)|'Derwent']], built in 1845 by [[William and Alfred Kitching]] for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, is preserved at [[Darlington Railway Centre and Museum]].

==Usage==
All the major continental [[Europe]]an railways used 0-6-0s of one sort or another, though usually not in the proportions used in the United Kingdom. As in the United States, European 0-6-0 locomotives were largely restricted to switching and [[station pilot]] duties, though they were also widely used on short [[branch line]]s to haul passenger and freight trains. On most branch lines, though, larger and more powerful tank engines tended to be favoured.

===Australia===
In New South Wales, the [[New South Wales Z19 class locomotive|Z19]] class was a tender type with this wheel arrangement, as was the [[Victorian Railways Y class]].
The Dorrigo Railway Museum collection includes seven Locomotives of the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement, including two Z19 class (1904 and 1923), three 0-6-0 saddle tanks and two 0-6-0 side tanks.

===Finland===
[[Image:060loco.jpg|thumb|A handcrafted, 1:8 [[live steam]] scale model of a Finnish [[VR Class Vr1]]]]Tank locomotives used by Finland were the [[VR Class Vr1]] and [[VR Class Vr4]].

The [[VR Class Vr1]]s were numbered 530 to 544, 656 to 670 and 787 to 799. They had outside cylinders and were operational from 1913 to 1975. Built by [[Tampella]], Finland and [[Hanomag]] (Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG), they were nicknamed "Chicken". Number 669 is preserved at the [[Finnish Railway Museum]].

The Vr4s were a class of only four locomotives, numbered 1400 to 1423, originally built as 0-6-0s by [[Vulcan Iron Works]], USA, but modified to 0-6-2s in 1951-1955, and re-classified as Vr5.

[[Image:loco21.jpg|thumb|left|Restored VR Class C1 no. 21 at the [[Finnish Railway Museum]]]] Finland’s tender locomotives were the classes C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6.

The [[Finnish Steam Locomotive Class C1]]s were a class of ten locomotives numbered 21 to 30. They were operational from 1869 to 1926. They were built by [[Neilson and Company]] and were nicknamed "Bristollari". Number 21, preserved at the [[Finnish Railway Museum]], is the second oldest preserved locomotive in Finland.

The eighteen Class C2s were numbered 31 to 43 and 48 to 52. They were also nicknamed "Bristollari".

The C3 was a class of only two locomotives, numbered 74 and 75.

The thirteen Class C4s were numbered 62 and 78 to 89.

The fourteen [[Finnish Steam Locomotive Class C5]]s were numbered 101 to 114. They were operational from 1881 to 1930. They were built by [[Hanomag]] in Hannover and were nicknamed "Bliksti". No 110 is preserved at the [[Finnish Railway Museum]].

The C6 was a solitary class of one locomotive, numbered 100.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand the 0-6-0 design was restricted to tank engines. The [[Hunslet]]-built [[NZR M class|M class]] of 1874 and Y class of 1923 provided 7 examples, however the [[NZR F class|F class]] built between 1872 and 1888 was the most prolific, surviving the entire era of NZR steam operations, with 88 examples of which 8 were preserved.

====Narrow gauge====
In 1871 two {{RailGauge|2ft6in|lk=on}} gauge tank locomotives, built by the [[Lilleshall Company]] of Oakengates, Shropshire in 1870 and 1871, were placed in service by the Cape of Good Hope Copper Mining Company. Named [[Namaqualand 0-6-0 1871|John King and Miner]], they were the first steam locomotives to enter service on the hitherto mule-powered Namaqualand Railway between [[Port Nolloth]] and the Namaqualand copper mines around [[O'okiep]] in the Cape Colony.<ref name="Bagshawe">{{Bagshawe}}</ref>{{rp|8–11}}

In 1902 [[Orenstein & Koppel|Arthur Koppel]], acting as agent, imported a single 0-6-0 {{RailGauge|2ft}} narrow gauge tank steam locomotive for a customer in Durban. It was then purchased by the Cape Government Railways and used as [[CGR NG 0-6-0T 1903|construction locomotive on the Avontuur]] branch from 1903. In 1912 this locomotive was assimilated into the South African Railways and in 1917 it was sent to German South West Africa during the [[World War I]] campaign in that territory.<ref name="Dulez 150"/>{{rp|232}}<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>{{rp|111–112, 157}}

===South West Africa (Namibia)===
[[File:DSWA Zwillinge 73A & B.jpg|thumb|Krauss factory picture of Zwillinge 73 A & B, c. 1899]]
Between 1898 and 1905 more than fifty pairs of [[South African Class Zwillinge 0-6-0T|Zwillinge]] twin tank steam locomotives were acquired by the ''Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn'' ([[Swakopmund]]-[[Windhoek]] State Railway) in [[Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika]] (DSWA, now [[Namibia]]). Zwillinge locomotives were a class of small {{RailGauge|600mm}} "Schmalspur" ([[narrow gauge]]) {{nowrap|0-6-0T}} tank steam locomotives that were built in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As indicated by their name "Zwillinge" (twins), they were designed to be used in pairs, semi-permanently coupled back-to-back at the cabs, allowing a single footplate crew to fire and control both locomotives. The pairs of locomotives shared a common manufacturer’s works number and running number, with the units being designated as A and B. By 1922, when the SAR took control of all railway operations in South West Africa (SWA), only two single Illinge locomotives survived to be absorbed onto the roster of the SAR.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne">{{Paxton-Bourne}}</ref>{{rp|21–24, 26, 117, 121}}

In 1907 the German Administration in DSWA acquired three [[South African Class Hc 0-6-0T|Class Hc]] tank locomotives for the [[Otavi Mining and Railway Company]]. One more entered service in 1910, and another was obtained by the South African Railways in 1929.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>{{rp|116}}

===Switzerland===
During World War II [[Switzerland]] converted some 0-6-0 shunting engines into [[electric-steam locomotive]]s.

===United Kingdom===
The 0-6-0 tender locomotive type was extremely common in Britain for more than a century and was still being built in large numbers during the 1940s. 943 examples of the [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] DX goods class were built between 1858 and 1872 by the [[London and North Western Railway]] and the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]]. This was the earliest example of standardisation and mass production of locomotives.<ref>H.C. Casserley, ''The historic locomotive pocket book'', Batsford, 1960, p.23.</ref>

[[File:SR Q1 Class C1 at Sheffield Park.jpg|thumb|Preserved Class Q1 locomotive 33001]]Of the total stock of standard-gauge locomotives operating on British railways in 1900, around 20,000 engines, over a third were 0-6-0 tender types. The ultimate British 0-6-0 was the [[SR Class Q1|Q1 "Austerity"]] type developed by the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] during the [[Second World War]] to haul very heavy freight trains. It was the most powerful steam 0-6-0 design produced in Europe.

Similarly, the 0-6-0 [[tank locomotive]]s became the most common locomotive type on all [[railway]]s throughout the 20th century. All of the [[Big Four British railway companies|Big Four companies]] to emerge from the [[Railways Act 1921|Railways Act, 1921]] grouping used them in vast numbers. The [[Great Western Railway]], in particular, had many of the type, most characteristically in the form of the [[pannier tank]] locomotive that remained in production well past [[Nationalization|railway nationalisation]] in 1948.

When diesel shunters began to be introduced, the 0-6-0 type became the most common. Many of the [[British Railways]] shunter types were {{nowrap|0-6-0s}}, including [[British Rail Class 03|Class 03]], the standard light shunter, and [[British Rail Class 08|Class 08]] and [[British Rail Class 09|Class 09]], the standard heavier shunters.

===United States of America===
In the [[United States]], huge numbers of 0-6-0 locomotives were produced, with the majority of them being used as switchers. The [[USRA 0-6-0]] was the smallest of the [[USRA standard locomotives|USRA Standard]] classes designed and produced during the brief government control of the railroads through the [[United States Railroad Administration|USRA]] during [[World War I]]. 255 of them were built and ended up in the hands of about two dozen US [[railroad]]s.

[[Image:USRA 0-6-0.jpg|thumb|right|A USRA 0-6-0]]In addition, many of the railroads (and others) built numerous copies after the war. The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] rostered over 1,200 0-6-0 types over the years, which were classed as type B on that system. The US 0-6-0s were generally [[tender locomotive]]s.

During the [[Second World War]] no fewer than 514 [[USATC S100 Class]] 0-6-0 tank engines were built by the [[Davenport Locomotive Works]], for use by the [[Transportation Corps (United States Army)|United States Army Transportation Corps]] in both Europe and North Africa. Some of these remained in service long after the war, having been purchased or otherwise adopted by the countries where they were used. These included Austria, Egypt, France, Iraq, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia.

The [[SR USA Class|fourteen engines]] purchased by the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] in 1946 remained in service well into the 1960s. Designed to be extremely strong but easy to maintain, these engines had a very short [[wheelbase]] that allowed them to operate on dockyard railways.

==Suffixes==

===Steam===
For a steam [[tank locomotive]], the suffix usually indicates the type of tank or tanks:
* 0-6-0T = side tanks
* 0-6-0ST = saddle tank
* 0-6-0PT = pannier tanks
* 0-6-0WT = well tank

Other suffixes include
* 0-6-0VB = vertical boiler
* 0-6-0F = [[fireless locomotive]]
* 0-6-0G = [[geared steam locomotive]]

===Diesel===
For a [[diesel locomotive]], the suffix indicates the transmission type:
* 0-6-0DM = [[mechanical transmission]]
* 0-6-0DH = [[Torque converter|hydraulic transmission]]
* 0-6-0DE = [[Diesel-electric transmission|electric transmission]]
