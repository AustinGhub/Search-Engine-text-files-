The '''1982 FIFA World Cup''', the 12th [[FIFA World Cup]], was held in Spain from 13 June to 11 July 1982.

The tournament was won by [[Italy national football team|Italy]], after defeating [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 3–1 in the final in the Spanish capital of Madrid. It was Italy's third World Cup win and first since [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]]. The holders [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]  were eliminated in the second group round. Algeria, Cameroon, Honduras, Kuwait and New Zealand made their first appearances in the finals.

The tournament featured two of the greatest matches in World Cup history: Italy's sensational win over [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in a [[Brazil v Italy (1982 FIFA World Cup)|second round]] game and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]'s [[West Germany v France (1982 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final]] defeat of [[France national football team|France]] via the first ever penalty shoot-out in World Cup competition.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Tim|title=1982: Why Brazil V Italy Was One Of Football's Greatest Ever Matches|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/sport/6396/1982-why-brazil-v-italy-was-one-of-footballs-greatest-ever-matches/|website=Esquire|accessdate=20 May 2015|date=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ger|first1=McCarthy|title=Memory Lane – West Germany v France at World Cup 82|url=http://backpagefootball.com/memory-lane-west-germany-v-france-at-world-cup-82/21132/|publisher=Backpage Football|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>

In the first round of Group 3, Hungary defeated El Salvador 10–1, equalling the largest margin of victory ever recorded in the finals (Hungary over South Korea 9–0 in 1954, and Yugoslavia over Zaire 9–0 in 1974).

==Host selection==
{{main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}
Spain was chosen as the host nation by FIFA in London, England on 6 July 1966. Hosting rights for the 1974 and 1978 tournaments were awarded at the same time.  West Germany agreed a deal with Spain by which Spain would support West Germany for the 1974 tournament, and in return West Germany would allow Spain to bid for the 1982 World Cup unopposed.

==Qualification==

For the first time, the World Cup finals expanded from 16 to 24 teams. This allowed more teams to participate, especially from Africa and Asia.

Teams absent from the finals were [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] runners-up [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (eliminated by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and [[France national football team|France]]), [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (eliminated by [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]]), and the three times 1970s participants [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (eliminated by [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]). Northern Ireland qualified for the first time since 1958. Belgium, [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]], [[England national football team|England]], and the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] were back in the Finals after a 12-year absence. England had its first successful World Cup qualifying campaign in 20 years<ref name = "falklands">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20856004 |title=World Cup withdrawal considered amid Falklands War |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=28 December 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> – the [[England national football team|English team]] had qualified automatically as hosts in 1966 and as defending champions in 1970, then had missed the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] were also back after having missed the 1978 tournament.

[[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], and [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] all participated in the World Cup for the first time. As of 2014, this was the last time that [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]], [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] and [[Peru national football team|Peru]] qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals.

There was some consideration given as to whether England, Northern Ireland and Scotland should withdraw from the tournament due to the [[Falklands War]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom.<ref name = "falklands"/> A directive issued by the British sports minister [[Neil Macfarlane (politician)|Neil Macfarlane]] in April, at the start of the conflict, suggested that there should be no contact between British representative teams and Argentina.<ref name = "falklands"/> This directive was not rescinded until August, following the end of hostilities.<ref name = "falklands"/> Macfarlane reported to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] that some players and officials were uneasy about participating due to the casualties being suffered by British forces.<ref name = "falklands"/> FIFA advised the British Government that there was no prospect of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (the defending champions) being asked to withdraw.<ref name = "falklands"/> It also became apparent that no other countries would withdraw from the tournament.<ref name = "falklands"/> It was decided to allow the British national teams to participate because it could have been used for propaganda purposes by Argentina, rather than having the intended effect of applying political pressure onto Argentina.<ref name = "falklands"/>

==Summary==

===Format===
[[File:Estatuamundial82.JPG|thumb|right|180px|1982 FIFA World Cup statue in Riazor Stadium, [[La Coruña]].]]
The 1982 competition used a unique format.  The first round was a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stage containing six groups of four teams each.  Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw, with [[goal difference]] used to separate teams equal on points.  The top two teams in each group advanced.  In the second round, the twelve remaining teams were split into four groups of three teams each, with the winner of each group progressing to the knockout semi-final stage.

The composition of the groups in the second round was predetermined before the start of the tournament. In the aggregate, Groups A and B were to include one team from each of Groups 1 through 6, and Groups C and D included the remaining six teams. The winners of Groups 1 and 3 were in Group A whilst the runners-up were in Group C. The winners of Groups 2 and 4 were in Group B whilst the runners-up were in Group D. The winner of Group 5 was in Group D whilst the runner-up was in Group B. The winner of Group 6 was in Group C whilst the runner-up was in Group A. Thus, Group A mirrored Group C, and Group B mirrored Group D with the winners and runners-up from the first round being placed into opposite groups in the second round.

The second-round groups that mirrored each other (based on the first-round groupings) faced off against each other in the semifinals. Thus, the Group A winner played the Group C winner, and the Group B winner player the Group D winner. This meant that if two teams which played in the same first-round group both emerged from the second round, they would meet for the second time of the tournament in a semifinal match. It also guaranteed that the final match would feature two teams that had not previously played each other in the tournament. As it turned out, Italy and Poland who were both in Group 1 in the first round, each won their second-round groups and played each other in a semifinal match.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://soccernostalgia.blogspot.ie/2015_05_01_archive.html|title= 1982 FIFA World Cup Outline|date=31 May 2015|work=Soccernostalgia |accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>	

===First round===

In Group 1, newcomers [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] held both [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] to draws, and were denied a place in the next round on the basis of having scored fewer goals than Italy (the sides had an equal goal difference). Poland and Italy qualified over Cameroon and [[Peru national football team|Peru]]. Italian journalists and [[tifosi]] criticised their team for their uninspired performances that managed three draws; the squad was reeling from the recent [[Totonero 1980|Serie A scandal]], where national players were suspended for match fixing and illegal betting.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19820624&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title= Italy qualify with two goals in three games|date=24 June 1982|work=Glasgow Herald (page 19)|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>	

Group 2 saw one of the great World Cup upsets on the first day with the 2–1 victory of [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] over reigning European Champions [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. In the final match in the group, West Germany met [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. {{Details|Disgrace of Gijón|this match}} Algeria had already played their final group game the day before, and West Germany and Austria knew that a West German win by 1 or 2 goals would qualify them both, while a larger German victory would qualify Algeria over Austria, and a draw or an Austrian win would eliminate the Germans. After 10&nbsp;minutes of all-out attack, West Germany scored through a goal by [[Horst Hrubesch]]. After the goal was scored, the two teams kicked the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match. Chants of "''Fuera, fuera''" ("''Out, out''") were screamed by the Spanish crowd, while angry Algerian supporters waved [[banknotes]] at the players. This performance was widely deplored, even by the German and Austrian fans. One German fan was so upset by his team's display that he burned his German flag in disgust.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Booth |author2=Smyth, Rob |title=What's the dodgiest game in football history? |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/aug/11/theknowledge.sport |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62Egs2PLO | archivedate = 6 October 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> Algeria protested to FIFA, who ruled that the result be allowed to stand; FIFA introduced a revised qualification system at subsequent World Cups in which the final two games in each group were played simultaneously.

Group 3, where the opening ceremony and first match of the tournament took place, saw [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] beat defending champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 1–0. The [[Camp Nou]] stadium was the home of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], and many fans had wanted to see the club's new signing, Argentinian star [[Diego Maradona]], who did not perform to expectations. Both Belgium and Argentina ultimately advanced at the expense of [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] despite [[Hungary vs El Salvador (1982)|Hungary's 10–1 win]] over the Central American nation — which, with a total of 11 goals, is the second highest scoreline in a World Cup game (equal with Brazil's 6–5 victory over Poland in the 1938 tournament and Hungary's 8–3 victory over West Germany in the 1954 tournament).

Group 4 opened with [[England national football team|England]] midfielder [[Bryan Robson]]'s goal against [[France national football team|France]] after only 27&nbsp;seconds of play. England won 3–1 and qualified along with France over [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]], though the tiny Gulf emirate held Czechoslovakia to a 1–1 draw. In the game between Kuwait and France, with France leading 3–1, France midfielder [[Alain Giresse]] scored a goal vehemently contested by the Kuwait team, who had stopped play after hearing a piercing whistle from the stands, which they thought had come from Soviet referee [[Miroslav Stupar]]. Play had not yet resumed when Sheikh [[Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]], brother of the Kuwaiti Emir and president of the Kuwaiti Football Association, rushed onto the pitch to remonstrate with the referee. Stupar countermanded his initial decision and disallowed the goal to the fury of the French. [[Maxime Bossis]] scored another valid goal a few minutes later and France won 4–1.

In Group 5, [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] held hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]] to a 1–1 draw. [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] won the group outright, eliminating [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and beating hosts Spain 1–0; Northern Ireland had to play the majority of the second half with ten men after [[Mal Donaghy]] was dismissed. Spain scraped by thanks to a controversial penalty in the 2–1 victory over Yugoslavia. At 17 years and 41 days, Northern Ireland forward [[Norman Whiteside]] was the youngest player to appear in a World Cup match.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19820626&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title= Ten-man Irish in fairytale victory|date=26 June 1982|work=Glasgow Herald (page 19)|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>	

[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] were in Group 6. With [[Zico]], [[Sócrates]], [[Paulo Roberto Falcão|Falcão]], [[Éder Aleixo de Assis|Éder]] and others, they boasted an offensive firepower that promised a return to the glory days of [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]]. They beat the [[USSR national football team|USSR]] 2–1 thanks to a 20&nbsp;metre Éder goal two minutes from time, then [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] with four goals each. The Soviets took the group's other qualifying berth on goal difference at the expense of the Scots.

===Second round===

Poland opened Group A with a 3–0 defeat of Belgium thanks to a [[Zbigniew Boniek]] [[Perfect Hat-Trick|hat-trick]]. The Soviet Union prevailed 1–0 in the next match over Belgium. The Poles edged out the USSR for the semi-final spot on the final day on goal difference thanks to a 0–0 draw in a politically charged match, as Poland's then-Communist government had imposed a [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] a few months earlier to quash internal dissent.

In Group B, a match between England and West Germany ended in a goalless draw. West Germany put the pressure on England in their second match by beating Spain 2–1. The home side drew 0–0 against England, denying [[Ron Greenwood]]'s team a semi-final place and putting England in the same position as Cameroon, being eliminated without losing a game.

In Group C, with Brazil, Argentina and Italy, in the opener, Italy prevailed 2–1 over [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Mario Kempes]]'s side after a game in which Italian defenders [[Gaetano Scirea]] and [[Claudio Gentile]] proved themselves equal to the task of stopping the Argentinian attack. Argentina now needed a win over Brazil on the second day, but lost 3–1 — Argentina only scoring in the last minute. Diego Maradona kicked Brazilian player [[João Batista da Silva|João Batista]] in the groin and was sent off in the 85th minute.

The [[Brazil vs Italy (1982)|match between Brazil and Italy]] pitted Brazil's attack against Italy's defense, with the majority of the game played around the Italian area, and with the Italian midfielders and defenders returning the repeated set volleys of Brazilian shooters such as [[Zico]], [[Sócrates]] and [[Paulo Roberto Falcão|Falcao]]. Italian centre back Gentile was assigned to mark Brazilian striker Zico, earning a yellow card and a suspension for the semi-final. [[Paolo Rossi]] opened the scoring when he headed in [[Antonio Cabrini]]'s cross with just five minutes played. Sócrates equalised for Brazil seven minutes later. In the twenty-fifth minute Rossi stepped past [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Júnior]], intercepted a pass from [[Toninho Cerezo|Cerezo]] across the Brazilians' goal, and drilled the shot home. The Brazilians threw everything in search of another equalizer, while Italy defended bravely. On 68 minutes, Falcão collected a pass from Junior and as Cerezo's dummy run distracted three defenders, fired home from 20 yards out. Now Italy had gained the lead twice thanks to Rossi's goals, and Brazil had come back twice; At 2–2, Brazil would have been through on goal difference, but in the 74th minute, a poor clearance from an Italian corner kick went back to the Brazilian six-yard line where Rossi and [[Francesco Graziani]] were waiting. Both aimed at the same shot, Rossi connecting to get a hat trick and sending Italy into the lead for good. In the 86th minute [[Giancarlo Antognoni]] scored an apparent fourth goal for Italy, but it was wrongly disallowed for offside. In the dying moments [[Dino Zoff]] made a miraculous save to deny [[Oscar (footballer, born 1954)|Oscar]] a goal, ensuring that Italy advanced to the semi-final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/sport/6396/1982-why-brazil-v-italy-was-one-of-footballs-greatest-ever-matches/|title=1982: Why Brazil V Italy Was One Of Football's Greatest Ever Matches|publisher=Esquire.co.uk|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Foot|authorlink=John Foot (historian)|title=Winning at All Costs: A Scandalous History of Italian Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBufCsXpkVkC&pg=PA470 |page=470|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref>

In the last group, Group D, France dispatched Austria 1–0 thanks to a brilliant free kick by [[Bernard Genghini]] and then beat Northern Ireland 4–1 to reach their first semi-final since [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]].

===Semi-finals, third-place match, and final===
[[File:Pallone di spagna 1982 firmato dai protagonisti.JPG|thumb|Official ball of Spain '82 signed by the winning team of Italy]]
In a re-match of the encounter in the first round, Italy beat Poland in the first semi-final through two goals from Paolo Rossi. In the game between France and West Germany, the Germans opened the scoring through a [[Pierre Littbarski]] strike in the 17th minute, and the French equalised nine minutes later with a [[Michel Platini]] penalty. In the second half a long through ball sent French defender [[Patrick Battiston]] racing clear towards the German goal. With both Battiston and the lone German defender trying to be the first to reach the ball, Battiston flicked it past German keeper [[Harald Schumacher]] from the edge of the German penalty area and Schumacher reacted by jumping up to block. Schumacher didn't seem to go for the ball, however, and clattered straight into the oncoming Battiston – which left the French player unconscious and knocked two of his teeth out. Schumacher's action has been described as "one of history's most shocking fouls".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4148525.stm "World's worst refereeing decisions"], BBC, 5 January 2005 {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/62Egt24j0|date =6 October 2011}}</ref> The ball went just wide of the post and Dutch referee [[Charles Corver]] deemed Schumacher's tackle on Battiston not to be a foul and awarded a [[goal kick]]. Play was interrupted for several minutes while Battiston, still unconscious and with a broken jaw, was carried off the field on a stretcher.

After French defender [[Manuel Amoros]] had sent a 25-metre drive crashing onto the West German crossbar in the final minute, the match went into extra time. On 92&nbsp;minutes, France's sweeper [[Marius Trésor]] fired a swerving volley under Schumacher's crossbar from ten metres out to make it 2–1. Six minutes later, an unmarked [[Alain Giresse]] drove in an 18-metre shot off the inside of the right post to finish off a counter-attack and put France up 3–1. But West Germany would not give up. In the 102nd minute a counter-attack culminated in a cross that recent substitute [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] turned in at the near post from a difficult angle with the outside of his foot, reducing France's lead to 3–2. Then in the 108th minute Germany took a short corner and after France failed to clear, the ball was played by Germany to Littbarski whose cross to [[Horst Hrubesch]] was headed back to the centre towards [[Klaus Fischer]], who was unmarked but with his back to goal. Fischer in turn volleyed the ball past French keeper [[Jean-Luc Ettori]] with a [[bicycle kick]], levelling the scores at 3–3.

The match went to [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]], with France and West Germany participating in the first ever [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] at a World Cup finals. Giresse, [[Manfred Kaltz]], [[Manuel Amoros]], [[Paul Breitner]] and [[Dominique Rocheteau]] all converted penalties until [[Uli Stielike]] was stopped by Ettori, giving France the advantage. But then Schumacher stepped forward, lifted the tearful Stielike from the ground, and saved [[Didier Six]]'s shot. With Germany handed the lifeline they needed Littbarski converted his penalty, followed by Platini for France, and then Rummenigge for Germany as the tension mounted. France defender Maxime Bossis then had his kick parried by Schumacher who anticipated it, and Hrubesch stepped up to score and send Germany to the World Cup final yet again with a victory on penalties, 4–5.

In the third-place match, Poland edged the French side 3–2 which matched Poland's best ever performance at a World Cup previously achieved in 1974. France would go on to win the [[UEFA Euro 1984|European Championship]] two years later.

In the final, [[Antonio Cabrini]] fired a penalty wide of goal in the first half. In the second half, Paolo Rossi scored first for the third straight game by heading home Gentile's bouncing cross at close range. Exploiting the situation, Italy scored twice more on quick counter-strikes, all the while capitalising on their defence to hold the Germans. With Gentile and Gaetano Scirea holding the centre, the Italian strikers were free to counter-punch the weakened German defence. [[Marco Tardelli]]'s shot from the edge of the area beat Schumacher first, and [[Alessandro Altobelli]], the substitute for injured striker [[Francesco Graziani]], made it 3–0 at the end of a solo sprint down the right side by the stand-out winger [[Bruno Conti]]. Italy's lead appeared secure, encouraging Italian president [[Sandro Pertini]] to wag his finger at the cameras in a playful "not going to catch us now" gesture. In the 83rd minute Paul Breitner scored a goal against  [[Dino Zoff]], but Italy claimed their first World Cup title in 44 years, and their third in total with a 3–1 victory.

==Records==
Italy became the first team to advance from the first round without winning a game, drawing all three (while [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] were eliminated in the same way), and also the only World Cup winner to draw or lose three matches at the Finals. By winning, Italy equalled Brazil's record of winning the World Cup three times. Italy's total of twelve goals scored in seven matches set a new low for average goals scored per game by a World Cup winning side (subsequently exceeded by Spain in 2010), while Italy's aggregate goal difference of +6 for the tournament remains a record low for a champion, equalled by Spain.

Italy's 40-year-old captain-goalkeeper [[Dino Zoff]] became the oldest-ever player to win the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/zoff/|title=World Cup Hall of Fame: Dino Zoff|newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912055524/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/zoff/|archivedate=12 September 2005}}</ref> This was the first World Cup in which teams from all six continental confederations participated in the finals, something that did not happen again until [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]].

==Venues==
17 stadiums in 14 cities hosted the tournament.<ref name="Capacity">Stadium capacities, Panini official album to World Cup 1982.</ref> The most used stadium was [[FC Barcelona]]'s [[Camp Nou]] stadium which hosted 5 matches including a semi-final match; it was the largest stadium used for this tournament and still is one of the largest stadiums in Europe. In addition to Barcelona's Sarria Stadium hosting 3 total matches, Barcelona was the Spanish city with the most matches in Espana '82 with 8; the Spanish capital of Madrid followed with 7.

This particular World Cup was organized in such a way where all of the matches of each of the six groups of four were assigned stadiums in cities close in proximity to each other; reducing the stress of travel on the players and fans. For example: Group 1 only played in Vigo and A Coruña, Group 2 only played in Gijon and Oviedo, Group 3 only played in Elche and Alicante (except for the first match, which was the opening match of the tournament, which was played at the Camp Nou), Group 4 played only in Bilbao and Valladolid (England played all their first round group matches in Bilbao), Group 5 (which included hosts Spain) was played exclusively in Valencia and Zaragoza, and Group 6 played exclusively in Seville and Malaga (of the 3 1st round matches in Seville, the first match between Brazil and the USSR was played in the Pizjuan Stadium, and the other two were played in the Villamarin Stadium).

When the tournament went into the round-robin second round matches, all the aforementioned cities excluding Barcelona, Alicante and Seville did not host any more matches in Espana '82. Both the [[Estadio Santiago Bernabeu|Santiago Bernabeu]] and [[Estadio Vincente Calderon|Vincente Calderon]] stadiums in Madrid and the Sarria Stadium in Barcelona were used for the first time for this tournament for the second round matches. Madrid and Barcelona hosted the four second round group matches; Barcelona hosted Groups A and C (Camp Nou hosted all 3 of Group A's matches, and Sarria did the same with Group C's matches) and Madrid hosted Groups B and D ([[Real Madrid]]'s Bernabeu Stadium hosted all 3 of Group B's matches, and [[Atletico Madrid]]'s Calderon Stadium did the same with the Group D matches)

The two semi final matches were held at Camp Nou and the Pizjuan Stadium in Seville, the third largest stadium used for the tournament (one of only 2 Espana '82 matches it hosted), the third place match was held in Alicante and the final was held at the Bernabeu, the second largest stadium used for this tournament.<ref>http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1982/wc82index.html</ref>

Spain's hot summer climate was avoided by playing most matches in the late afternoon or at night; for instance Seville- which is one of the hottest cities in Europe, with June and July average temperatures going past the 90s Fahrenheit (32 Celsius)- could only play its matches at 21:00.

===Second round===
The second round of matches consisted of four 3-way round-robin groups, each confined to one stadium in both of Spain's largest cities- 2 in Madrid, and 2 in Barcelona. The winners of each one of these groups would progress to the semi-finals. The 43,000-capacity Sarria Stadium in Barcelona, used for the Group C round-robin matches between Italy, Argentina and Brazil was, unlike any of the other matches (except 1) in the other groups - completely overcrowded for all 3 matches. The venue was then heavily criticized for its lack of space and inability to handle such rampant crowds; although no one had foreseen such crowds at all; the Group A matches held at the nearby and much larger 99,500-capacity Camp Nou stadium never went past 65,000 and hosted all European teams; it was anticipated there would be larger crowds for the Camp Nou-hosted second round matches between Belgium, the Soviet Union and Poland.<ref>http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/82-original-and-harshest-group-death#:cPSwuJlAjge9fA</ref>
