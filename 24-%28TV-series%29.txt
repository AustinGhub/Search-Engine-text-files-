===Overview===
{{Main|List of 24 episodes}}

'''[[24 (season 1)|Season 1]]''' begins at midnight on the day of the California presidential primary. [[Jack Bauer]]'s [[wikt:Special:Search/protocol|protocol]] is to protect Senator [[David Palmer (24 character)|David Palmer]] from an assassination plot and rescue his own family from those responsible for the plot, who seek retribution for Jack and Palmer's involvement with a covert American mission in the [[Balkans]].

'''[[24 (season 2)|Season 2]]''', set 18 months later, begins at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack must stop a nuclear bomb from detonating in Los Angeles, then assist President David Palmer in proving who is responsible for the threat.

'''[[24 (season 5)|Season 5]]''', set 18 months after, begins at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack is believed to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the American government.

'''[[24 (season 6)|Season 6]]''', set 20 months later, begins at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack is released after being detained in a Chinese prison following the events of Season 5. Terrorists who hold a vendetta against Jack plot to set off [[suitcase nuke|suitcase nuclear devices]] in America and he must secure them.

'''''[[24: Redemption|Redemption]]''''', set three-and-a-half years later, begins at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Jack finds himself caught up in a military coup in the fictional African nation of Sangala.

==Production==

===Conception===
The idea for the series first came from executive producer [[Joel Surnow]], who initially had the idea of a TV show with 24 episodes in a season. Each episode would be an hour long, taking place over the course of a single day.<ref name="kieferdangerous14">{{cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher |title=Kiefer Sutherland&nbsp;— Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|year=2009|edition=1|page=14|isbn=978-1-926745-55-8}}</ref> He discussed the idea over the phone with producer [[Robert Cochran (TV producer)|Robert Cochran]], whose initial response was "Forget it, that's the worst idea I've ever heard, it will never work and it's too hard".<ref name="genesis">{{cite video|people=[[Joel Surnow]] and [[Robert Cochran (TV producer)|Robert Cochran]] (co-creators)|title=24: The Complete First Season (Special Edition)&nbsp;– "The Genesis of 24"|medium=DVD|date=May 20, 2008|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> They met the next day at the [[International House of Pancakes]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]], to discuss the idea of this action-espionage series that used the format of real time to create dramatic tension with a race against the clock.<ref name=kieferdangerous14/>

The pilot for ''24'' was pitched to Fox who immediately bought it, saying they felt that the idea for the series was one that would "move the form of television forward".<ref name="kieferdangerous15">{{cite book|last=Heard|first=Christopher|title=Kiefer Sutherland&nbsp;— Living Dangerously|editor=Timothy Niedermann|publisher=Transit Publishing Inc.|year=2009|edition=1|page=15|isbn=978-1-926745-55-8}}</ref> The episode had a $4 million budget with filming in March 2001.

The pilot of the series was well received by critics, and was signed on for an initial thirteen episodes.

===Design===
[[File:24 Split Screen.jpg|thumb|250px|An example of a ''24'' split screen with the running clock, from the season 7 finale|alt=A split screen image from the TV series 24. In the image, it shows several different people, in different locations, depicted at the same time. This is used to show the viewer what different characters are doing at the same time]]

Although not the first to do so, ''24'' embraced the concept of [[Real time (media)|real time]]. This idea started when producer Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing "24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a "race against the clock".<ref name="genesis"/> Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display at the beginning and end of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen.<ref name="Hanks&nbsp;— Jack Back">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/jacks-back-the-clock-ticks-for-24s-antihero-1027348.html|title=Jack's back: The clock ticks for 24's antihero|last=Hanks|first=Robert|publisher=Independent News & Media Limited|date=November 21, 2008|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}</ref> The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode.<ref name="genesis"/> In line with the depiction of events in real time, ''24'' does not use [[slow motion]] techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours.<ref name="Hanks&nbsp;— Jack Back" /> As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.

Another idea was the use of [[Multi-dynamic image technique|split screens]], which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.<ref name="genesis"/>

A major concept used in the series was the idea of a running clock. This initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock which appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the [[in-universe]] time of the story.<ref name="genesis"/> When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.<ref name="ontheset">{{Cite episode |series=[[On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren]]|title=On the Set of 24|network=Fox News|airdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref>

===Setting===
The first six seasons of the show were mostly based in Los Angeles and nearby California locations—both real and fictional.<ref name="Ticonderoga"/> Other locations have also been featured, such as Washington, D.C., for parts of the fourth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The eighth season took place in New York City,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/arts/television/15twentyfour.html|title=Another Terrorist Plot, Another Very Long Day|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|work=The New York Times|date=January 15, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405110256/http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/arts/television/15twentyfour.html| archivedate= April 5, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and the TV film ''Redemption'', filmed in [[South Africa]], was set mainly in the fictional African nation of Sangala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/821/821061p1.html|title=IGN: 24: The Dead Rise|publisher=IGN|first=Eric|last=Goldman|date=September 19, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}</ref>

The main setting of the show is the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit. Its office consists of two main departments: Field Operations, which involves confronting and apprehending suspects, and Communications, which gathers intelligence and assists those that work in Field Operations. CTU offices are established in various cities with these units reporting to "Divisions", and Divisions reporting to the "District". While CTU itself is a fictional agency, several entities with similar names or duties, like the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], have emerged since the show's debut on television.<ref name="ante">{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28525607|title=24 ups the ante in Washington, D.C. |date=June 1, 2009|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}</ref>

The set of CTU was initially filmed in a Fox Sports office, with the set recreated in an old pencil factory in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]]. The same set was used for the first three seasons, but was redesigned before the start of the fourth season, and again before the start of the eighth season. Other sets were also constructed here, such as [[Charles Logan (24 character)|Charles Logan's]] presidential retreat shown in seasons five and six, and the [[White House]] bunker shown in seasons four and six.<ref name="Ticonderoga"/>

===Series conclusion===
On March 26, 2010, a statement was issued from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] which explained that season eight would conclude the original series. [[Kiefer Sutherland]] gave a statement:

{{cquote|This has been the role of a lifetime, and I will never be able to fully express my appreciation to everyone who made it possible. While the end of the series is bittersweet, we always wanted ''24'' to finish on a high note, so the decision to make the eighth season our last was one we all agreed upon. This feels like the culmination of all our efforts from the writers to the actors to our fantastic crew and everyone at Fox. Looking ahead to the future, Howard Gordon and I are excited about the opportunity to create the feature film version of ''24''. But when all is said and done, it is the loyal worldwide fan base that made it possible for me to have the experience of playing the role of Jack Bauer, and for that I am eternally grateful.<ref name="press release"/>}}

Executive producer and showrunner [[Howard Gordon]] was also a part of the decision. He was quoted saying:

{{cquote|Kiefer and I have loved every minute of making ''24'', but we all believe that now is the right time to call it a day. I echo his sentiments of gratitude toward the show's amazing creative team, as well as the studio and network who have always believed in us and shown us unbelievable support.}}

Peter Rice, Chairman of Entertainment at Fox Networks Group said, "''24'' is so much more than just a TV show&nbsp;– it has redefined the drama genre and created one of the most admired action icons in television history." Kevin Reilly, President of Entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Company added, "We are extremely proud of this groundbreaking series and will be forever thankful to Kiefer, the producers, the cast and crew for everything they've put into ''24'' over the years. It's truly been an amazing and unforgettable eight days.<ref name="press release">{{cite press release|publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company|title="24: Day Eight" Will Be the Award-Winning Series' Final Season|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100326fox02|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>

Immediately prior to ''24'', series co-creators [[Joel Surnow]] and [[Robert Cochran (TV producer)|Robert Cochran]] executive-produced ''[[La Femme Nikita (TV series)|La Femme Nikita]]'' for its entire five-year run on [[USA Network]]. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, and the lead characters of both series are placed in situations where they must make a tragic choice in order to serve the greater good. There are numerous on- and off-screen creative connections between ''24'' and ''La Femme Nikita''. Several actors from ''La Femme Nikita'' have portrayed similar roles on ''24'', a number of story concepts from ''La Femme Nikita'' have been revisited on ''24'', and many of the creative personnel from ''La Femme Nikita'' worked on ''24'' in their same role.<ref name="byebauer">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/article/813094--goodbye-mr-bauer|title=Goodbye, Mr. Bauer|last=Brioux|first=Bill|date=May 22, 2010|work=The Star|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name="timeoflives">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001184,00.html|title=Television: The Time Of Their Lives|last=McDowell|first=Jeane|date=November 12, 2001|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name="onmind">{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2003598190_loceff05.html|title="24"/ 7 Seattle-area TV writer always has Jack Bauer on his mind|last=Krug|first=Kurt Anthony|date=March 5, 2007|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

Similar to the 1997 film, ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'', ''24'' featured the president's personal jumbo-jet ([[Air Force One]]). Air Force One was featured in ''24'' seasons 2 and 4. [[Air Force Two]] (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in ''24'', such as [[Xander Berkeley]], [[Glenn Morshower]], [[Wendy Crewson]], [[Timothy Carhart]], [[Jürgen Prochnow]], [[Tom Everett]] and [[Spencer Garrett]] also appeared in the film ''Air Force One''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/search/name?roles=tt0285331,tt0118571|title=Most Popular People Credited in "24 (2001 TV Series)" And Credited in "Air Force One (1997)"|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> The [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th amendment]], which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series.

===Feature film development===
A feature film adaptation of ''24'' was originally planned for the hiatus between the sixth and seventh seasons. Series co-creators [[Joel Surnow]] and [[Robert Cochran (TV producer)|Robert Cochran]] were set to write the script with [[showrunner]] [[Howard Gordon]] working on story.<ref name="24movieannounced">{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117944863?refCatId=13|title=Fox counting down to '24' pic|first=Josef|last=Adalian|work=Variety|date=June 7, 2006|accessdate=June 3, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165944/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117944863?refCatId=13| archivedate= June 29, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Filming was going to take place in London, [[Prague]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name="24movielocations">{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/4529/sutherland-talks-24-movie-filming|title=Sutherland Talks "24" Movie Filming|first=Garth|last=Franklin|publisher=Dark Horizons|date=May 5, 2006|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref> Plans for the film were later put on hold. [[Kiefer Sutherland]] explained, "It's impossible to ask writers to work on the show and then come up with an amazing film we can shoot in the break between seasons."<ref name="24moviedelayedindef">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/s9/24/news/a44685/report-24-movie-delayed-indefinitely.html|title=Report: '24' movie delayed indefinitely|first=Ben|last=Rawson-Jones|publisher=Digital Spy|date=April 1, 2007|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

It was later decided that the film would begin after the conclusion of the eighth and final season. It was to be set and shot on-location in Europe. Joel Surnow, Robert Cochran, Howard Gordon, and Kiefer Sutherland were going to be executive producers on the film, and [[Billy Ray (screenwriter)|Billy Ray]] was going to write the screenplay.<ref name="europeset">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/s9/24/news/a202212/fox-confirms-europe-set-24-movie.html|title=Fox confirms Europe-set '24' movie|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|publisher=Digital Spy|date=February 9, 2010|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> Shooting was planned to start in late 2010 or early 2011.<ref name="europeset"/>

In April 2010, Kiefer Sutherland said in an interview at a [[BAFTA]] event in London that the script was finished and he would be reading it upon his return to the United States. He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/04/19/24-movie-script-ready|title=24 Movie Script Ready|first=Chris|last=Tilly|publisher=IGN|date=April 19, 2010|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> Sutherland described the film production as "exciting" because, "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so we were not going to be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sky1.sky.com/kiefer-sutherland-dishes-on-the-24-movie|title=Kiefer Sutherland Dishes on the 24 Movie!|publisher=Sky1|date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

In June 2010, it was reported that plans were made to create a film titled ''Die Hard 24/7'', which would serve as a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] between ''24'' and the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, with Kiefer Sutherland to reprise his role as Jack Bauer alongside [[Bruce Willis]]' [[John McClane]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/45415|title=You'll Never Believe How DIE HARD 24/7 Got Its Name&nbsp;... |publisher=Ain't It Cool News|date=June 9, 2010|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> However these plans never came to fruition, with the studio instead opting to create the film ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-die-hard-percy-jackson-247435|title=Fox Moves Ahead With New 'Die Hard' and 'Percy Jackson' Films|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref>

In November 2010, executive producer Howard Gordon revealed that a "work in progress" screenplay was being read by Fox, but that the film did not yet have a green light or fixed schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s9/24/tubetalk/a235405/qa-the-executive-producer-of-24.html|title=Q&A: The executive producer of '24'!|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|publisher=Digital Spy|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101112181456/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s9/24/tubetalk/a235405/qa-the-executive-producer-of-24.html| archivedate= November 12, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In December 2010, Howard Gordon revealed that Fox turned down the script by Billy Ray, saying, "It wasn't strong enough or compelling enough".

In May 2013, [[Deadline.com]] first reported that Fox was considering a limited-run "event series" for ''24'' based on a concept by [[Howard Gordon]], after failed efforts to produce the ''24'' feature film and the cancellation of [[Kiefer Sutherland]]'s series ''[[Touch (TV series)|Touch]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|publisher=Deadline.com|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 9, 2013|title=’24′ Eyes Return As Limited Series On Fox, Howard Gordon To EP, Kiefer Sutherland In Talks To Star|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/24-eyes-return-as-limited-series-on-fox-kiefer-sutherland-in-talks/}}</ref> The following week, Fox officially announced ''24: Live Another Day'', a limited-run series of twelve episodes that would feature the return of [[Jack Bauer]].

The quality of the acting was particularly celebrated by critics. Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' described [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as indispensable to the series, and that he had a "great, under-sung performance".<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Bianco|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2006-01-12-24_x.htm|title=Opener doesn't waste a second|work=USA Today|date=January 13, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref> [[Dennis Haysbert]]'s "commanding" performance as [[David Palmer (24 character)|David Palmer]] was hailed by critics, with some believing the character helped the campaign of [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a106486/haysbert-24-president-helped-obama.html|title=Haysbert: '24' president helped Obama|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|date=July 2, 2008|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref> David Leonhart of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised [[Gregory Itzin]]'s portrayal of President [[Charles Logan (24 character)|Charles Logan]], comparing his character to former U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Leonhart|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/business/media/17leonhardt.html|title=Bar the Door.

Critics were often disappointed by the series' reliance on poor subplots, specifically Teri's amnesia in [[24 (season 1)|season one]], Kim Bauer's storyline in [[24 (season 2)|season two]], and Dana Walsh's storyline in [[24 (season 8)|season eight]].

The use of torture and the negative portrayal of Muslims affected the decisions of some actors who intended to join the series.

However, she took on the role as she felt that people would understand that the show was fiction.<ref name="stereotype">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/23/arts/television/23rhod.html|title=Playing Against (Stereo)type|last=Rhodes|first=Joe|date=January 23, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name="inside">{{Cite episode |title=''24 Inside'' - Shohreh Aghdashloo and executive producer Peter Lenkov |series=24 |network=Fox |airdate=January 31, 2005}}</ref>

During an interview for his new television series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', ''24'' executive producer [[Howard Gordon]] addressed the impact of the series, describing it as "stunning - everyone from [[Rush Limbaugh]] to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." On the topic of torture and [[Islamophobia]] within the series, Gordon said, "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray in order to make it feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season two, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: "They could be next door." The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.<ref>{{cite web|first=Hamed|last=Aleaziz|url=http://motherjones.com/media/2011/10/homeland-season-2-claire-danes-howard-gordon-alex-gansa?page=2|title=Interrogating the Creators of Homeland|publisher=Mother Jones|date=November 4, 2011|accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref>

After the series finale, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' characterized the series as "an [[epic poem]], with Jack Bauer in the role of [[Odysseus]] or [[Beowulf]]. Which means he needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision." The critic went on to say that villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that "Jack and ''24'' fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity."<ref>{{cite web|last=MacNamara|first=Mary|title=Television review: The '24' finale|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/25/entertainment/la-et-0525-24-review-20100525|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 25, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref> One reviewer for BuddyTV said that "I'll remember the legacy of ''24'' as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubicek|first=John|title='24' Series Finale Review: The Legacy of Jack Bauer|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/24/24-series-finale-review-the-le-36759.aspx|publisher=BuddyTV|date=May 24, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' said "''24'' will live on, possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks.

===Ratings===
Seasonal rankings were based on average total viewers per episode of ''24'' on Fox. Most U.S. network television seasons start in mid-September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of May [[sweeps]]. ''24'' aired during both February and May sweeps periods in all of its seasons, and during the November sweeps period in its first three seasons. Beginning with its fourth season, ''24'' began its season in January and aired new episodes non-stop until May.

===Awards and nominations===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by 24}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|"''24'' has changed the face of television--one hour, one minute, one second at a time. This is a masterpiece of episodic storytelling and continues to deal with the bright color issues in America's war on terror with a degree of difficulty that is off today's television charts. Powerful and involving, with characters who are more fully realized with each season, the show still has viewers on the edge of their seats, both riveted to the action and begging, pleading for a modicum of relief."|source=—Judges of the [[American Film Institute]] on the show's inclusion in the [[American Film Institute Awards 2005|2005 list.]]<ref name="topten"/>}}

''24'' was nominated for and won several other television awards including the [[Emmy Award]]s, [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. It is one of only five TV series (along with ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'') ever to have won the [[Emmy Award]], the [[Golden Globe]] and the [[Satellite Award]] for Best Drama Series.

''24'' was nominated in categories for acting, directing, writing, editing, sound, music score, and stunt coordination.

''24'' was distributed across the globe.

The release of ''24'' on DVD had a significant impact on the success of the television series. In an interview with [[IGN]] in 2002, Sutherland revealed, "[''24'''s] success in [the UK] was phenomenal. It was the biggest show the BBC has ever had. It was the number one DVD there, knocking off ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', which is unheard of for a television show DVD to actually knock-out every feature DVD available.
