The '''1960 Summer Olympics''', officially known as the '''Games of the XVII Olympiad''' (Italian: ''Giochi della XVII Olimpiade''), was an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] held from August 25 to September 11, 1960 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Rome had been awarded the organization of the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], but after the [[Mount Vesuvius#Eruptions in the 20th century|1906 eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]], was forced to decline and pass the honors to [[1908 Summer Olympics|London]].

==Host city selection==
On June 15, 1955, at the 50th [[IOC Session]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], Rome beat out Lausanne, Detroit, Budapest (being the first city of the [[Eastern Bloc]] to bid for the Olympic Games), Brussels, Mexico City and Tokyo for the rights to host the Games. Tokyo and Mexico City would eventually host the following [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and [[1968 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html|title=IOC VOTE HISTORY|publisher=}}</ref>

[[Toronto]] was initially interest in the bidding, but appears to have been dropped during the final bid process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/24/toronto-has-made-5-attempts-to-host-the-olympics-could-the-sixth-be-the-winner.html|title=Toronto has made 5 attempts to host the Olympics. Could the sixth be the winner?|date=24 July 2015|work=thestar.com}}</ref> This is the first of five attempts by Toronto from 1960 to 2001.

===Broadcasting===
* [[CBS]] paid $394,000 (${{Inflation|US|394,000|r=-4|1960}} in today's dollars) for the exclusive right to broadcast the Games in the United States.  This was the first Summer Olympic games to be telecast in [[North America]].  In addition to CBS in the United States, the Olympics were telecast for the first time in [[Canada]] (on [[CBC Television]]) and in [[Mexico]] (through the networks of [[Televisa|Telesistema Mexicano]]). Since television broadcast satellites were still two years into the future, CBS, CBC, and Televissa shot and edited videotapes in Rome, fed the tapes to Paris where they were re-recorded onto other tapes which were then loaded onto jet planes to North America. Planes carrying the tapes landed at [[John F. Kennedy Airport|Idlewild Airport]] in [[New York City]], where mobile units fed the tapes to CBS, to Toronto for the CBC, and to Mexico City for Televisa. Despite this arrangement, many daytime events were broadcast in North America, especially on CBS and CBC, the same day they took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/O/htmlO/olympicsand/olympicsand.htm |title=OLYMPICS AND TELEVISION - The Museum of Broadcast Communications |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>
