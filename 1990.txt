Important events of '''1990''' include the [[German reunification|Reunification of Germany]] and [[Yemeni unification]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/652831/Yemen/273073/Unification-of-Yemen|title=Yemen|work=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> the formal beginning of the [[Human Genome Project]] (finished in 2003), the launch of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the separation of [[Namibia]] from South Africa, and the [[Baltic states]] declaring independence from the [[Soviet Union]] amidst [[Perestroika]]. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communist regime]] collapses amidst increasing internal tensions and multiparty elections held within its [[Constituent state|constituent republics]] result in [[Separatism|separatist]] governments being elected in most of the republics marking the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. Also in this year began the crisis that would lead to the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 following the [[Iraq]]i invasion and the largely internationally unrecognized annexation of [[Kuwait]] resulting in a crisis in the [[Persian Gulf]] involving the issue of the sovereignty of Kuwait and fears by Saudi Arabia over Iraqi aggression against their oil fields near Kuwait, this resulted in Operation [[Desert Shield]] being enacted with an international coalition of military forces being built up on the Kuwaiti-Saudi border with demands for Iraq to peacefully withdraw from Kuwait. Also in this year, [[Nelson Mandela]] was released from prison, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] resigned as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] after over 11 years.

1990 was an important year in the [[Internet]]'s early history. In the fall of 1990, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] created the first [[web server]] and the foundation for the [[World Wide Web]]. Test operations began around December 20 and it was released outside of [[CERN]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/History.html|title=WWW Project History|work=w3.org}}</ref> 1990 also saw the official decommissioning of the [[ARPANET]], a forerunner of the [[Internet]] system and the introduction of the first content [[search engine]], [[Archie search engine|Archie]] on September 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~chip/projects/timeline/1990archie.htm|title=The first search engine,Archive|work=illinois.edu}}</ref>

September 14, 1990 saw the first case of successful somatic [[gene therapy]] on a patient.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenlink.com/2010/06/09/gene-therapy-a-brief-history/|title=Gene Therapy – A Brief History|work=CitizenLink}}</ref>

Due to the [[early 1990s recession]] that began that year and uncertainty due to the collapse of the [[socialist]] governments in [[Eastern Europe]], birth rates in many countries stopped rising or fell steeply in 1990. In most western countries the [[Echo Boom]] peaked in 1990; fertility rates declined thereafter.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db136.pdf</ref>

''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which ceased printing in 2012, saw its highest all time sales in 1990; 120,000 volumes were sold that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nooga.com/154314/encyclopaedia-britannica-ceases-publication-after-244-years/|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica ceases publication after 244 years|work=Nooga.com}}</ref> The number of [[librarian]]s in the United States also peaked around 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=Librarians in the U.S. from 1880-2009 &#124; OUPblog <!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE -->|url=http://blog.oup.com/2011/06/librarian-census/|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hth6iZuM|archivedate=2013-07-05|deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>
