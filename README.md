# Search-Engine-text-files-
Building Search engine and deploying a website with flask that searches for words in a big folder of text files
My partner, Austin Truong and I used the ideas behind TF-IDF to find where words would be weighted by TF-IDF values and results would show which document our searched word occurs most in.
We then used cosine similarity to find similarities.
