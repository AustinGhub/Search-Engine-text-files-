The '''1964 Summer Olympics''', officially known as the {{nihongo4|'''Games of the XVIII Olympiad'''|第十八回オリンピック競技大会|Dai Jūhachi-kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai}}, was an international [[multi-sport event]] held in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], from October 10 to 24, 1964. Tokyo had been awarded the organization of the [[1940 Summer Olympics]], but this honor was subsequently passed to [[Helsinki]] because of Japan's [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion of China]], before ultimately being canceled because of [[World War II]]. 

The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia, and the first time [[Apartheid South Africa and the Olympics|South Africa was barred from taking part]] due to its [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid system]] in sports.<ref>''BBC'' On This Day, 18 August, "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/18/newsid_3547000/3547872.stm 1964: South Africa banned from Olympics".]</ref><ref>{{cite web|

These games were also the first to be telecast internationally without the need for tapes to be flown overseas as they were for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]] four years earlier. The games were telecast to the United States using [[Syncom]] 3, the first [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] communication satellite, and from there to Europe using [[Relay 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-1RVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7T4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5918%2C2615007|title=The Miami News - Google News Archive Search|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> These were also the first Olympic Games to have color telecasts (partially).  Certain events like the sumo wrestling and judo matches, sports huge in Japan, were tried out using Toshiba's new color transmission system, but only for the domestic market.  History surrounding the 1964 Olympics was chronicled in the 1965 documentary film ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'', directed by [[Kon Ichikawa]].

The games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the city's midsummer heat and humidity and the September [[typhoon]] season.<ref name=avdritk>{{cite journal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1075316/index.htm |magazine=Sports Illustrated |title=A very dry run in Tokyo|last=Griggs |first=Lee |date=October 28, 1963 |page=64}}</ref> The previous Olympics in [[Rome]] in [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]] started in late August and experienced hot weather. The following games in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] in [[Mexico City]] also began in October.

==Host city selection==

Tokyo won the rights to the Games on May 26, 1959, at the 55th [[IOC Session]] in Munich, [[West Germany]], over bids from Detroit, Brussels and Vienna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html|title=IOC Vote History|publisher=Aleksandr Vernik|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref>

[[Toronto]] was an early bidder again in 1964 after the fail attempt for 1960 and failed to make the final round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/24/toronto-has-made-5-attempts-to-host-the-olympics-could-the-sixth-be-the-winner.html|title=Toronto has made 5 attempts to host the Olympics.

* [[Kumi-daiko]] was first exhibited to a world-wide audience at the Festival of Arts presentation.<ref name=Varian>{{cite book|last=Varian|first=Heidi|title=The Way of Taiko: 2nd Edition|year=2013|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=1611720125|pages=28–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PuRSmQEACAAJ}}</ref>

The [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japanese women's volleyball team]] won the gold medal, with the final being broadcast live.
* The [[women's pentathlon]] ([[shot put]], [[high jump]], [[hurdling]], [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] and [[long jump]]) was introduced to the athletics events.
* Reigning world champion [[Osamu Watanabe]] capped off his career with a gold medal for Japan in freestyle wrestling, surrendering no points and retiring from competition as the only undefeated Olympic champion to date at 189–0.
* [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|Soviet]] gymnast [[Larisa Latynina]] won two gold medals (both for the third time in a row in Team Competition and [[Gymnastics floor|Floor Exercise]] events), a silver medal and two bronze medals. She held the record for most Olympic medals at 18 (9 gold, 5 silver, 4 bronze) which stood until broken by American swimmer [[Michael Phelps]] in [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]].
* [[Czechoslovakia]]n gymnast [[Věra Čáslavská]] wins 3 gold medals, including the individual all-around competition, crowning her the new queen over the reigning champion [[Larisa Latynina]].

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
[[File:1964 Summer Olympic games countries.png|thumb|240px|Participants]] [[File:1964 Summer olympics team numbers.gif|thumb|Number of athletes per country]]
A total of 93 nations were represented at the 1964 Games. Sixteen nations made their first Olympic appearance in Tokyo: Algeria, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire (as ''Ivory Coast''), Dominican Republic, Libya (but it did not compete), Madagascar, Malaysia, Mali, Mongolia, Nepal, Niger, [[Northern Rhodesia]] (which achieved full independence as Zambia on the same day as the closing ceremony), Senegal, and Tanzania (as ''Tanganyika''). It was the last of three appearances at the [[Summer Olympics]] by a Rhodesian representation; athletes from [[Southern Rhodesia]] competed under the banner of [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]]. [[Zimbabwe at the Olympics|Zimbabwe]] would make [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|its first appearance]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. Athletes from [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] and [[West Germany]] competed together as the [[United Team of Germany]] from 1956 to 1964. Indonesia was banned for this Olympic Games, due to its refusal to allow Israeli and Taiwanese athletes visas at the [[1962 Asian Games]].

[[Transpac (cable system)|TRANSPAC-1]], the first trans-Pacific [[Submarine communications cable|communications cable]] from Japan to Hawaii was also finished in June 1964 in time for these games. Before this, most communications from Japan to other countries were via shortwave.<ref name="committee_v1p2_communications"/>

The start of operations for the first Japanese "bullet train" (the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen|Tokaido Shinkansen]]) between [[Tokyo Station]] and [[Shin-Ōsaka Station]] was scheduled to coincide with the Olympic games. The first regularly scheduled train ran on October 1, 1964, just 9 days before the opening of the games, transporting passengers {{convert|515|km|mi|sp=us}} in about 4 hours, and connecting the three major metropolitan areas of Tokyo, [[Nagoya]], and [[Osaka]].

Some already-planned upgrades to both highways and commuter rail lines were rescheduled for completion in time for these games. Of the 8 main expressways approved by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in 1959, No. 1, No. 4 and a portion of No. 2 and No. 3 were completed for the games. Two subway lines totaling {{convert|22|km|mi|sp=us}} were also completed in time for the games, and the port of Tokyo facilities were expanded to handle the anticipated traffic.<ref name="committee_v1p1_transport">{{Harvnb|Organizing Committee|1964|pp=47–49}}</ref>

== Legacy ==

The 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo celebrated Japan's progress and reemergence on the world stage. The new Japan was no longer a wartime enemy, but a peaceful country that threatened no one, and this transformation was accomplished in fewer than 20 years.<ref name="rebirth">{{cite web|url=http://aboutjapan.japansociety.org/content.cfm/japans_rebirth_at_the_1964_tokyo_summer|title=Japan's Rebirth at the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics|last=Droubie|first=Paul|date=July 31, 2008|work=aboutjapan.japansociety.org|publisher=About Japan: A Teacher's Resource|accessdate=January 10, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115040409/http://aboutjapan.japansociety.org/content.cfm/japans_rebirth_at_the_1964_tokyo_summer| archivedate=January 15, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>

Although Japan's foreign policy was closely linked to the United States during the Cold War, the city of Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics in the spirit of peaceful engagement with the entire international community, including the Communist states.  The goals were  to demonstrate to the world that Japan had fully recovered from the war, had disavowed imperialism and militarism, welcomed high-caliber sports, and sought to engage the peoples of the world on a grassroots level. Sports were kept entirely separate from politics.  The event  proved a great success for the city and for Japan as a whole, with no untoward incidents. Japan's foreign-policy was expanded to include sports diplomacy as the nation sent teams to international competitions across the globe.<ref>Jessamyn R. Abel, "Japan's Sporting Diplomacy: The 1964 Tokyo Olympiad," ''international History Review'' (2012) 24#2 pp 203-220.</ref>

To host such a major event, Tokyo's infrastructure needed to be modernized in time for large numbers of expected tourists. Enormous energy and expense was devoted to upgrading the city's physical infrastructure, including new buildings, highways, stadiums, hotels, airports and trains.  There was a new satellite to facilitate live international broadcast.  Multiple train and subway lines, a large highway building project, and the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen|Tokaido Shinkansen]], the fastest train in the world, were completed. [[Tokyo International Airport|Haneda International Airport]] and the [[Port of Tokyo]] were modernized. International satellite broadcasting was initiated, and Japan was now connected to the world with a new undersea communications cable.<ref name="committee_v1p2_communications"/> The [[YS-11]], a commercial turboprop plane developed in Japan, was used to transport the Olympic Flame within Japan.<ref name="committee_v1p1_torch">{{Harvnb|Organizing Committee|1964|pp=245–269}}</ref> For swimming, a new timing system started the clock by the sound of the starter gun and stopped it with touchpads. The photo finish using a photograph with lines on it was introduced to determine the results of sprints. All of this demonstrated that Japan was now part of the first world and a technological leader, and at the same time demonstrated how other countries might modernize.<ref name="rebirth"/>  In preparation for the games, 200,000 stray cats and dogs were rounded-up and euthanized.<ref name="japantimes.co.jp">Whiting, Robert, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/10/24/olympics/negative-impact-1964-olympics-profound/#.VGNHKY0cR9A Negative impact of 1964 Olympics profound]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 October 2014, p. 14</ref>

Unfortunately, however, the construction projects resulted in some environmental damage, forced relocations for some residents, and loss of some industries.  In addition, corruption by politicians and construction companies resulted in cost overruns and some shoddy work.<ref name="japantimes.co.jp"/>

Although public opinion about the Olympics in Japan had initially been split, by the time the games started almost everyone was behind them. The broadcast of the opening ceremony was watched by over 70% of the viewing public, and the women's volleyball team's gold medal match was watched by over 80%.<ref name="rebirth"/>

As with many other Olympics, observers later stated that 1964 Olympic preparation and construction projects had had a negative effect on the environment and lower income people.<ref>[[Robert Whiting|Whiting, Robert]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/10/24/olympics/negative-impact-1964-olympics-profound/#.VEy8zo0cR9A Negative impact of 1964 Olympics profound]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 25 October 2014, p. 14</ref>

The [[Cary Grant]] film ''[[Walk, Don't Run]]'' was filmed during the Tokyo Olympics, and set in Tokyo during the Olympics. A message at the beginning of the film thanks the Japanese Government and Tokyo Police for putting up with them filming in crowded Tokyo.

The [[Studio Ghibli]] film ''[[From Up on Poppy Hill]]'' takes place one year before the Tokyo Olympics.

Tokyo has attempted to bring the Olympic Games back to the city, having unsuccessfully [[Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|bid]] for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], which were awarded to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Tokyo will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and [[2020 Summer Paralympics]] games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan’s Capital Tokyo to host 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/japans-capital-tokyo-to-host-2020-olympic-and-paralympic-games/|accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref> Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host the games twice.

== Boycotting countries ==
{{main|GANEFO}}
North Korea withdrew its athletes from Japan just before the beginning of the Olympics when the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] refused the athletes who participated in the [[GANEFO]] (Games of the New Emerging Forces) which was held in Jakarta, Indonesia. Indonesia and China also did not attend the 1964 Summer Olympics due to GANEFO issues.
