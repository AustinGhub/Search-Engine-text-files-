The '''1920 Summer Olympics''' ({{lang-fr|Les Jeux olympiques d'été de 1920}}), officially known as the '''Games of the VII Olympiad''', were an international [[multi-sport event]] in 1920 in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].
In March 1912, during the 13th session of the IOC, the bid on the behalf of Belgium to host the 1920 Summer Olympics was made by Baron [[Édouard de Laveleye]], president of the Belgian Olympic Committee and of the Royal Belgian Football Association. No fixed host city was proposed at the time.

The [[1916 Summer Olympics]], to be held in Berlin, capital of the [[German Empire]], were cancelled due to the war. The [[Aftermath of World War I|aftermath of the war]] and the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] affected the Olympic Games not only due to new states being created, but also by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and were blamed for starting it. [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were banned from competing in the Games. Germany remained banned until 1925, and instead hosted a series of games called [[Deutsche Kampfspiele]], starting with the Winter edition of 1922 (which predated the first Winter Olympics).

The [[Sailing at the 1920 Summer Olympics|Sailing events]] were held in [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]], and two in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

==Host city selection==
In March 1912, during the 13th [[List of IOC meetings|session of the IOC]], the bid on the behalf of Belgium to host the 1920 Summer Olympics was made by Baron [[Édouard de Laveleye]], president of the [[Belgian Olympic Committee]] and of the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]]. No fixed host city was proposed at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Renson|first=Roland|title=The Games Reborn. The VIIth Olympiad Antwerp 1920|year=1996|publisher=Pandora|location=Antwerp|isbn=90-5325-051-4|page=11}}</ref>

The organising committee was created on 9 August 1913. It had four presidents:
*Édouard de Laveleye, president of the Belgian Olympic Committee
*[[Henri de Baillet-Latour]], member of the [[IOC]]
*[[Robert Osterrieth]], president of the [[Royal Yacht Club of Belgium]]
*[[Charles Cnoops]], vice-president of the [[Belgian Fencing Association]]

Among the 22 vice-presidents of the committee were people with a military or industrial background, and further people from sports organisations like [[Paul Havenith]], president of the football and athletics club [[K. Beerschot V.A.C.]] and [[Nicolaas Jan Cupérus]], president of the [[Belgian Gymnastics Federation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Renson|first=Roland|title=The Games Reborn. The VIIth Olympiad Antwerp 1920|year=1996|publisher=Pandora|location=Antwerp|isbn=90-5325-051-4|page=12}}</ref>

The first action of the committee was to send an official letter to the IOC in Paris, confirming Antwerp as the city for the Belgian Olympic bid. On 13 September 1913, [[Pierre de Coubertin]], president of the IOC, visited the grounds of the future [[Olympisch Stadion (Antwerp)|Olympic Stadion]] in Beerschot.

In 1914, a 109-page brochure was created to promote the idea of Antwerp as a host city for the Olympics: ''Aurons-nous la VIIème Olympiade à Anvers?'' (''Will we have the 7th Olympiad at Antwerp?''). It was sent to all IOC members and was used during the [[List of IOC meetings|6th Olympic Congress]] in Paris in 1914, where the candidacies of Amsterdam, Antwerp, Budapest, and Rome were discussed. Despite a slight preference at the time for Budapest, no final choice was made, and the outbreak of [[World War I]] soon afterwards prevented any further progress.<ref>{{cite book|last=Renson|first=Roland|title=The Games Reborn. The VIIth Olympiad Antwerp 1920|year=1996|publisher=Pandora|location=Antwerp|isbn=90-5325-051-4|page=13}}</ref>

In 1915, [[Lyon]] made a bid for the 1920 games, but after some discussion, they agreed to support Antwerp and postpone their bid until 1924 if Antwerp was liberated in time to organise the games. The support for Belgium by cousin country France, then the leading country of the IOC, also meant that Amsterdam, and Budapest, in an enemy state, made no chance for the 1920 games against Antwerp. New candidacies from American cities did not have that disadvantage though, and bids were received from [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Atlanta]] (which would eventually host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]), and Cuba also planned a bid for [[Havana]]. But shortly after the armistice in November 1918, the IOC decided to give Antwerp the first choice, if they still wanted to host the 1920 Games. In March 1919, the Belgian Olympic Committee decided to go ahead with the organisation, and on 5 April 1919, in a meeting in Lausanne, Antwerp was officially declared the host city for the games of the VIIth Olympiad.<ref>{{cite book|last=Renson|first=Roland|title=The Games Reborn. The VIIth Olympiad Antwerp 1920|year=1996|publisher=Pandora|location=Antwerp|isbn=90-5325-051-4|page=14}}</ref>

==Organization==
An executive committee was established on 17 April 1919, with Henri de Baillet-Latour as chairman and Alfred Verdyck, the secretary of the Belgian Union of Football Clubs, as general secretary. Seven commissions were created, to deal with finances, accommodation, press relations, propaganda, schedules, transport, and festivities. Finances and scheduling proved to be the two hardest parts to tackle: the programme of events only was published in February 1920, six months to the official start of the Games.

Between 23 and 30 April 1920, an ice hockey tournament marked the early start of the Games. Held in the "Palais de Glace" or Ice Palace in Antwerp, it was the first time that ice hockey was an Olympic sport.<ref>{{cite book|last=Renson|first=Roland|title=The Games Reborn. The VIIth Olympiad Antwerp 1920|year=1996|publisher=Pandora|location=Antwerp|isbn=90-5325-051-4|pages=15–17}}</ref>

The first stone of the new Olympic Stadium at Beerschot was laid on 4 July 1919 by [[Jan De Vos]], mayor of Antwerp, and inaugurated less than a year later on 23 May 1920 with a [[gymnastics]] demonstration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Renson|first=Roland|title=The Games Reborn. The VIIth Olympiad Antwerp 1920|year=1996|publisher=Pandora|location=Antwerp|isbn=90-5325-051-4|pages=18–19}}</ref>

The nautical stadium or [[Stade Nautique d'Antwerp]] was built at the end of the [[Jan Van Rijswijcklaan]], using the city ramparts there as a spectator's stand. Other events, like shooting, boxing, and equestrian sports, were held at pre-existing locations in and around Antwerp and as far away as [[Ostend]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Renson|first=Roland|title=The Games Reborn.

==Highlights==
* These Olympics were the first in which the [[Olympic Oath]] was voiced, the first in which doves were released to symbolize peace, and the first in which the [[Olympic Flag]] was flown.
* The USA won 41 gold, 27 silver, and 27 bronze medals, the most won by any of the 29 nations attending. Sweden, Great Britain, Finland, and Belgium rounded out the five most successful medal-winning nations.
* The Games also featured a week of winter sports, with [[figure skating]] appearing for the first time since the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics]], and [[ice hockey]] making its Olympic debut.
* [[Nedo Nadi]] won 5 gold medals in the fencing events.
* At the age of 72, Sweden's [[100 metre running deer double-shot]] event champion [[Oscar Swahn]] won in the team event to become the oldest Olympic champion ever.
* 23-year-old [[Paavo Nurmi]] won the 10,000 m and 8,000 m [[cross country at the 1920 Summer Olympics|cross country]] races, took another gold in team cross country, and a silver in the 5,000 m run. His contributions for [[Finland]] broke the U.S. dominance record in track and field with 9 medals.
* [[Duke Kahanamoku]] retained the 100 m swimming title he won before the war.
* In a rather strange moment in Olympic history, the 12-foot dinghy event in [[Sailing at the 1920 Summer Olympics|sailing]] took place in two different countries. The final two races in the event were independently held in the [[Netherlands]], on its own accord, supposedly because the only two competitors in the event were Dutch.<ref name="ioc_games">{{IOC games|games=1920 Summer Olympics }}</ref>
*[[Sport shooter]] [[Guilherme Paraense]] won [[Brazil]]'s first ever gold medal at the Olympic Games.

A total of 29 nations participated in the Antwerp Games, only one more than in 1912, as Germany, [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Turkey]] were not invited, having lost World War I. From the newly created European states, only [[Estonia]] took part, and [[Czechoslovakia]], succeeding [[Bohemia]] which had sent athletes prior to World War I as part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. [[Poland]] was busy with the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and therefore was unable to form an Olympic team. [[Soviet Russia]] was also not invited as part of its political embargo by the West.  [[Argentina]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], [[Brazil]], and [[Monaco]] competed as nations at the Olympic Games for the first time. New Zealand, which had competed as part of a combined team with Australia in 1908 and 1912, competed on its own for the first time.
