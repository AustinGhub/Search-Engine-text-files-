The '''1952 Summer Olympics''' (Finnish: ''Kesäolympialaiset 1952'') (Swedish: ''Olympiska sommarspelen 1952''), officially known as the '''Games of the XV Olympiad''', were an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] held in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], in 1952. Helsinki had been earlier selected to host the [[1940 Summer Olympics]], which were cancelled due to [[World War II]]. It is the northernmost city at which a summer Olympic Games have been held. It was also the Olympic Games at which the most number of world records were broken until surpassed by the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bascomb |first=Neal |title=The Perfect Mile: Three Athletes, One Goal, and Less Than Four Minutes to Achieve It |publisher=Mariner Books |year=2005 |isbn=9780618562091}}</ref> The [[Soviet Union]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Israel]], and [[Saar at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Saarland]] made their Olympic debuts in Helsinki 1952.

==Host city selection==
Helsinki was chosen as the host city over bids from Amsterdam and five American cities at the 40th [[IOC Session]] on June 21, 1947, in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Minneapolis]] and [[Los Angeles]] finished tied for second in the final voting.

== Highlights ==
[[File:Olympiatuli 1952.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Paavo Nurmi and the Olympic Flame]]

* These were the final Olympic Games organised under the IOC presidency of [[Sigfrid Edström]].
* For the first time, a team from the [[Soviet Union]] participated in the Olympics. The first gold medal for the USSR was won by [[Nina Romashkova]] in the women's [[discus throw]]ing event. The Soviet women's gymnastics team won the first of its eight consecutive gold medals.
* [[Israel]] made its Olympic debut. The Jewish state had been unable to participate in the 1948 Games because of its [[Israeli War of Independence|War of Independence]]. A previous Palestine Mandate team had boycotted the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]] in protest of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime.
* The newly established [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) participated in the Olympics for the first time, although only one swimmer ([[Wu Chuanyu]]) of its 40-member delegation arrived in time to take part in the official competition.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Mulvenney |title=Chen Chengda, China's almost Olympian |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK30776220080807 |agency=Reuters |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> The PRC would not return to the Summer Olympics until [[Los Angeles 1984]].
* The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) withdrew from the Games on July 20, in protest of the IOC decision to allow athletes from the People's Republic of China to compete.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News |title=On This Day: 1952: 20 July: Zatopek wins gold at Helsinki |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_3538000/3538602.stm |accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref>
* The [[Olympic Flame]] was lit by two Finnish heroes, [[running|runners]] [[Paavo Nurmi]] and [[Hannes Kolehmainen]]. Nurmi first lit the cauldron inside the stadium, and later the flame was relayed to the stadium tower where Kolehmainen lit it. Only the flame in the tower was burning throughout the Olympics.
* [[Hungary]], a country of 9 million inhabitants, won 42 medals at these games, coming in third place behind the much more populous United States and Soviet Union.
* [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]'s ''[[Golden Team]]'' won the [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|football]] tournament, beating [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] 2–0 in the final.
* Germany and Japan were invited after being barred in 1948. Following the post-war occupation and partition, three German states had been established. Teams from the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] (which joined the FRG after 1955) participated; the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) was absent. Though they won 24 medals, the fifth-highest total at the Games, German competitors failed to win a gold medal for the only time.
* Rules in [[equestrianism]] now allowed non-military officers to compete, including women. [[Lis Hartel]] of [[Denmark]] became the first woman in the sport to win a medal.
* [[Emil Zátopek]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] won three gold medals in the [[5000 m]], [[10,000 m]] and the [[Marathon]] (which he had never run before).
* The [[India men's national field hockey team|India national field hockey team]] won its fifth consecutive gold.
* [[Bob Mathias]] of the United States became the first Olympian to successfully defend his [[decathlon]] title with a total score of 7,887 points.
* [[Josy Barthel]] of [[Luxembourg]] pulled a major surprise by winning the 1500 m.

[[File:1952 Summer olympics team numbers.gif|thumb|Number of athletes per country]]
A total of 69 nations participated in these Games, up from 59 in the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Games]]. Thirteen nations made their first Olympic appearance in 1952: [[The Bahamas]], the [[China|People's Republic of China]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]), [[Guatemala]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]], [[Netherlands Antilles]], [[Nigeria]], [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. 

[[Japan]] and [[Germany]] were both reinstated and permitted to send athletes after being banned for 1948 for their instigation of [[World War II]]. Due to the [[division of Germany]], German athletes from [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]] entered a separate team for the only time. Only [[West Germany]] would provide athletes for the actual Germany team, since East Germany refused to participate in a joint German team.
