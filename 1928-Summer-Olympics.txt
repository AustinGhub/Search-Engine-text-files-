The '''1928 Summer Olympics''' (Dutch: ''Olympische Zomerspelen 1928''), officially known as the '''Games of the IX Olympiad''', was an [[international]] [[multi-sport event]] which was celebrated in 1928 in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. Amsterdam had bid for the 1920 and 1924 [[Olympic Games]], but had to give way to wartorn [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], and [[Pierre de Coubertin]]'s [[Paris]], respectively. The only other candidate city for the 1928 Games was [[Los Angeles]], which would host the Olympics four years later.

The [[United States Olympic Committee]] measured the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games in preparation for the [[1932 Summer Olympics]]. The committee reported a total cost of [[United States dollar|US$]]1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million for a loss of US$18,000—much less than that of the previous Games.<ref name=Zarnowski>{{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C.

==Highlights==
* These Olympics were the first to be organised under the IOC presidency of [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]]
* For the first time, the [[Olympic Flame]] was lit during the Olympics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amsterdam 1928|url=http://www.olympic.org/amsterdam-1928-summer-olympics|publisher=Olympic.org|accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref> The torch relay, however, would not occur until the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].
* For the first time, the parade of nations started with [[Greece]], which holds the origins of the Olympics, and ended with the host country, a tradition which continues today.
* The Games were officially opened by [[Prince Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Prince Hendrik]], consort of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], who had authorized him to deputise for her. This was the second time a head of state had not personally officiated at an [[Olympic Games ceremony#Opening|Olympic opening ceremony]]. The first at the games of 1904 in [[St.&nbsp;Louis]], Missouri, by [[David R. Francis]] the mayor of St.&nbsp;Louis. In opposition he had refused offers by heads of state to do this, whereas the Queen refused as she was on holiday in [[Norway]] and did not want to disrupt her trip{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. The Queen was furious at the [[NOC*NSF|organizing committee]] for not consulting with her about the opening date{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}.
* [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] events were held on a 400-meter track, later becoming the standard for athletics tracks.
* These games were the first to feature a standard schedule of 16 days, which is still followed. Previously, competition had been stretched out over several months.
* [[Johnny Weissmuller]], who later appeared in several [[Tarzan]] movies, won two gold medals in [[swimming (sport)|swimming]].
* [[Paavo Nurmi]] of [[Finland]] won his ninth and final gold medal in the 10,000&nbsp;m race.
* [[Canada]]'s [[Percy Williams (sprinter)|Percy Williams]] surprised everyone by winning both the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m sprint events.
* [[South America]]n [[association football|football]] made a definite breakthrough, as [[Uruguay]] retained its title by defeating [[Argentina]].
* India took its first ever gold in the sport of [[field hockey]], beginning a streak of six consecutive gold medals in the sport.
* [[Mikio Oda]] of Japan won the [[triple jump]] event with a result of {{convert|15.21|m|ftin|sp=us}}, becoming the first gold medalist from an Asian country.
* The then [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]], later King of Norway, was amongst the participants. He won a gold medal in sailing.
* [[Pat O'Callaghan]] won newly independent Ireland's first ever medal, taking gold in the hammer throw.
* The first appearance of the sponsor [[Coca-Cola]] at the Olympic Games.
* These games were the first to bear the name "Summer Olympic Games".
* Germany returned to the Olympic Games for the first time since 1912, after being banned from the 1920 and 1924 Games. The German team finished second in the 1928 medal count.

==Host city selection==
{{main|Bids for the 1928 Summer Olympics}}

Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as host city for the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in 1912, even before the [[NOC*NSF|Netherlands Olympic Committee]] was established. In 1916 the Olympic Games were cancelled due to [[World War&nbsp;I]]. In 1919 the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favour of their support of the nomination of [[Antwerp]] as host city for the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. In 1921 [[Paris]] was selected for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam. This decision, supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee, was announced by the [[International Olympic Committee]] on 2 June 1921. The decision was disputed by the Americans, but their request to allocate the 1928 Summer Olympics to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] was without success in 1922 and again in 1923.<ref>Chicago Tribune Co. "America Bids for Games: Olympics of 1928 May be Held in This Country", ''New York Times''. 6 April 1923.

Women's [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[gymnastics]] debuted at these Olympics, in spite of criticism. [[Halina Konopacka]] of [[Poland]] became the first female Olympic track and field champion. Reports that 800 meter run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted were widely (and erroneously) circulated, leading to running events for women longer than 200 meters being excluded from the Olympics until the 1960s.

[[Tennis]] disappeared from the program, only to reappear in [[Tennis at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 as a demonstration sport]].

==Poster==
[[File:1928-summer-oympics-poster.jpg|thumb|200px|The official poster.]]
The official poster for the Games was designed by Jos Rovers, and 10,000 copies were made. The poster displays a running man in a white shirt, with in the background the Olympic stadium and the Olympic flag (shown above). The IOC never succeeded in getting the copyright of the image. Therefore, out of practical considerations, the IOC has used a different poster, with the [[German language|German]] text ''Olympische Spiele'', and an athlete partly covered in the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch national flag]], holding a peace leaf in his hand. This poster was made for a German book about the Amsterdam Olympics.<ref>Henk van Gelder: [http://archief.nrc.nl/index.php/1996/Juli/30/Overig/18/De+Spiele+in+Amsterdam ''De Spiele in Amsterdam''], NRC Handelsblad 30 juli 1996</ref>
