'''Curtis James Jackson III''' (born July 6, 1975), better known by his [[stage name]] '''50 Cent''', is an American rapper, actor, entrepreneur, investor, record, film, and television producer. Born in the [[South Jamaica, Queens|South Jamaica]] neighborhood of the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]], Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s [[crack epidemic]]. Although he left drug-dealing to pursue a musical career, he was struck by nine bullets in a 2000 shooting. After Jackson released the compilation album ''[[Guess Who's Back?]]'' in 2002, he was discovered by [[Eminem]] and signed by [[Shady Records]], [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]].

With the aid of [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] (who produced his first major-label album, ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin']]''), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with [[East Coast hip hop]] group [[G-Unit]] (which he leads ''de facto''). In 2003 he founded [[G-Unit Records]], signing his G-Unit associates [[Young Buck]], [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Tony Yayo]]. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, ''[[The Massacre]]'', which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, ''[[Animal Ambition]]'', in 2014 and is working on his sixth studio album: ''Street King Immortal'', scheduled for release in 2016.

During his career Jackson has sold over 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide and won [[List of awards and nominations received by 50 Cent|several awards]], including a [[Grammy Award]], thirteen [[Billboard Music Award]]s, six [[World Music Awards]], three [[American Music Award]]s and four [[BET Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/five-reasons-i-self-destruct-flopped|title=Five Reasons Before I Self Destruct Flopped|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=November 26, 2009}}</ref> He has pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (film)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' (2005), the Iraq War film ''[[Home of the Brave (2006 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' (2006) and ''[[Righteous Kill]]'' (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s, the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and [[Nelly]]), and ''Get Rich or Die Tryin''' and ''The Massacre'' were ranked the 12th and 37th best albums of the decade by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.

===2000–01: Shooting===
On April 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman (alleged to be Darryl "Hommo" Baum) outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard.<ref name=MSNBC/> After Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a [[9 mm caliber|9mm]] [[handgun]].

Jackson recalled the shooting: "It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back&nbsp;.... I was scared the whole time&nbsp;... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.{{'"}}<ref name=MTV/> In his autobiography, ''From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens'', he wrote: "After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life&nbsp;... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone".<ref name=OMM/> After using a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] for six weeks, Jackson was fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the [[Pocono Mountains|Poconos]] with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.<ref name=RS/><ref name=MTV/><ref>Jenkins, Sacha (July 9, 2007).

==Feuds==

===Ja Rule===
Before he signed with Interscope Records Jackson engaged in a public dispute with rapper [[Ja Rule]] and his label, [[Murder Inc Records]], saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery.<ref name="Playboy"/> Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when Jackson did not like seeing him "getting so much love" from the neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/j/ja_rule/news_feature_031103/index.jhtml |title=Ja Rule on 50 Cent, God and Hip-Hop |publisher=Mtv.com |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> At [[The Hit Factory]] in New York in March 2000, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound.<ref name=Playboy/><ref>Smith, Dominic (July 2005).

An [[affidavit]] by an [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and [[Kenneth McGriff|Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff]], a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of [[Jam Master Jay]] and Jackson's shooting. An excerpt read:

{{quote|The investigation has uncovered a conspiracy involving McGriff and others to murder a rap artist who has released songs containing lyrics regarding McGriff's criminal activities. The rap artist was shot in 2000, survived and thereafter refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the shooting. Messages transmitted over the Murder Inc. pager indicate that McGriff is involved in an ongoing plot to kill this rap artist, and that he communicates with Murder Inc. employees concerning the target.<ref name=TSG/>}}

In an MTV interview, Ja Rule acknowledged his defeat by Jackson and said that his 2009 album, ''[[The Mirror (Ja Rule album)|The Mirror]]'', would not continue any feuds: "There was a lot of things I wanted to say, and I didn't want there to be any bitter records on the album. Because I'm not bitter about anything that happened [in the past few years]".{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, "I'm cool. We ain't beefing no more. We'll never collaborate. That's just what it is. You don't have to be at war with somebody, but it's also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don't gotta go to war, but we're not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world.

On August 7, 2015, the feud between the two rappers later reignited when Ja gave a feedback to a social follower via Twitter over a similar feud between [[Meek Mill]] and [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]. Enraged, 50 later responded back with photos and comments via Instagram, only siding with Drake.<ref>{{cite web|author =Natalie Weiner |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6655633/50-cent-ja-rule-beef-drake-meek-mill-beef-twitter-instagram |title=50 Cent & Ja Rule Beef Reignited by Drake & Meek Mill Feud |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>

===The Game===
Although Jackson was close to [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] before the latter released his debut album, ''The Documentary'', they grew apart. After ''The Documentary''{{'}}s release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers (such as [[Nas]], [[Jadakiss]] and [[Fat Joe]]) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.<ref>Reid, Shaheem (March 1, 2005).

[[File:50 cent in concert.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white closeup of 50 Cent singing onstage|At a 2007 concert]]
Jackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on [[WQHT|Hot 97]]. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building.<ref>Reid, Shaheem (February 28, 2005).

===Rick Ross===
Although [[Rick Ross]] began a feud with Jackson over an alleged incident at the January 2009 [[BET]] Awards, Jackson told news sources he did not remember seeing Ross there.<ref>{{cite news |title= How feud Started Rick Ross and 50 Cent |url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2009/01/50_cent_vs_rick_ross_video/ |publisher=Vide.com |date=February 7, 2009 |accessdate=March 16, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090321020855/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2009/01/50_cent_vs_rick_ross_video/| archivedate= March 21, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Late that month Ross' "[[Deeper Than Rap|Mafia Music]]" was leaked on the Internet, with lyrics apparently disparaging Jackson. Several days later, Jackson released "Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)" in response to "Mafia Music". The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem's Sirius channel) and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours.

Before leaving for [[Venezuela]], Jackson uploaded a video ("Warning Shot", telling Ross "I'ma fuck your life up for fun"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}) and the first of a series of "Officer Ricky" cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed "Tia", the mother of one of Ross' children; according to her, Ross is in reality a [[Prison officer|correctional officer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/videos/id.2138 |title=– 50 Cent – Interviews Rick Ross' Baby Mama |publisher=Hiphopdx.com |date=February 2, 2009 |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station [[KPWK|KUBE]].

On his album ''[[Deeper Than Rap]]'', Ross refers to Jackson in "In Cold Blood" and Jackson's mock funeral is part of the song's video.
